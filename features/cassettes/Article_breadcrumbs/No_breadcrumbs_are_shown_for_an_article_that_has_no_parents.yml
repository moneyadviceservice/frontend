        you afford to buy a property and, even if you can, is it a good idea \u2013
        or would you be better off renting instead?","body":"<html><body><p class=\"intro\"><img
        src=\"/images/should-you-rent-or-buy.jpg\"/>Buying a property is probably
        the biggest financial decision you\u2019ll ever have to make. How do you know
        whether it\u2019s the right decision for you right now \u2013 or whether you\u2019d
        be better off renting instead? </p><h2>Mortgage\u00a0or rent? </h2><p>Owning
        your own home is a huge commitment, not just to the building you buy and the
        area you choose to live in, but also to your life (and to another person if
        you are buying with a loved one or friend). </p><h3>Benefits of owning your
        home </h3><p>There are many benefits to home ownership. Here are just some
        of them. </p><ul><li>Once you\u2019ve paid off your mortgage, your home will
        be yours and it could be worth far more than you paid for it. </li></ul><ul><li>If
        your home increases in value you can use that equity to help you afford a
        bigger home or to fund a more comfortable retirement if you downsize. </li></ul><ul><li>When
        you retire you won\u2019t necessarily have the income you need to keep on
        paying rent \u2013 if you have paid your mortgage off you\u2019ll be living
        there \u2018rent free\u2019. </li></ul><ul><li>You can spend money improving
        your home and increasing its value, whereas you can\u2019t alter a rented
        home without the landlord\u2019s permission. </li></ul><ul><li>Sometimes it
        can be cheaper to buy than to rent.</li></ul><h3>Potential downsides of owning
        </h3><ul><li>It\u2019s a big financial commitment \u2013 you need to be sure
        you can afford what you\u2019re taking on. See the later section \u2018Can
        you afford to buy?\u2019 </li></ul><ul><li>You also need to be sure you can
        afford maintenance costs such as replacing a boiler if it packs up or fixing
        a leaky roof. If you stretch yourself too much when you buy you may resent
        not having money for meals out, holidays and entertainment. </li></ul><ul><li>You
        have less flexibility than when renting. For example, if you want to move
        for work or personal reasons selling up and moving on is far more expensive
        if you own as you\u2019ll have all of the associated estate agency and legal
        fees. Also bear in mind that it may not always be easy to sell your home \u2013
        you\u2019ll be dependent on what\u2019s happening in the market. </li></ul><ul><li>If
        you\u2019re living with someone else and split up, the process of sorting
        out the property will be far more complicated and expensive.</li></ul><h2>Are
        you better off buying or renting? </h2><p>You\u2019re not necessarily going
        to be better off financially buying rather than renting your home. </p><p>If
        the value of your property falls, you may find yourself unable to sell because
        you owe more to your mortgage lender than your home is worth. </p><p>On the
        other hand, if house prices rise, you could make a nice profit that could
        help fund a move to a bigger home or give you a lump sum if you choose to
        downsize later on in life. </p><h2>Can you afford to buy? </h2><p>The first
        step towards buying a property is figuring out whether you can afford to do
        so. There are many costs associated with buying your own home, beyond your
        mortgage repayments, including: </p><ul><li>deposit </li></ul><ul><li>legal
        costs such as solicitor\u2019s fees </li></ul><ul><li>survey cost </li></ul><ul><li>Stamp
        Duty </li></ul><ul><li>removal costs, and </li></ul><ul><li>your monthly bills
        \u2013 such as gas, electricity, home phone, etc.</li></ul><p>Use the links
        below to get a better idea of you likely costs. </p><p>If buying isn\u2019t
        an option for you right now, think about setting up a savings plan to achieve
        your goal in the future. </p><p><div class=\"add-action\"><a href=\"/en/articles/estimate-your-overall-buying-and-moving-costs\">Estimate
