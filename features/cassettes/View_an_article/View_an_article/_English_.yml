        explain what you need to know about Help to Buy - the government''s schemes
        aimed at first-time buyers with low deposits and current owners with limited
        equity. Read on for more Help to Buy information. </p><h2>Help to Buy Scheme
        - What is it? </h2><p>Help to Buy - the two main schemes: </p><ul><li><strong>Equity
        loans</strong> - the government lends you up to a fifth of the value of a
        new-build home in England. A similar equity loan scheme is available in Scotland,
        for properties valued up to \u00a3400,000.</li><li><strong>Mortgage guarantees</strong>
        - the government agrees to cover part of your mortgage if you only have a
        small deposit, taking on the default risk should you fall behind with payments.
        The property can be new-build or pre-owned and located in England, Northern
        Ireland, Scotland and Wales.</li></ul><h2>Help to Buy - The background </h2><div
        class=\"callout\"><h3>DID YOU KNOW? </h3><p>In 1985, average first-time buyers
        needed a deposit of 5% to buy a home - in 2012, this had increased to 20%
        <br/><strong>Source: HM Treasury </strong></p></div><p>Help to Buy is expected
        to help make up for the lack of higher loan-to-value products available. </p><p>While
        it\u2019s still occasionally possible for people with a deposit of only 5%
        to get on the property ladder, the government felt there should be more competition
        between mortgage lenders to provide greater choice to home buyers. </p><p>Savings
        rates and wage increases are also well below the rate of inflation, making
        it harder for buyers to save a deposit. </p><p>Another big reason for the
        introduction of the scheme comes down to current rises in house prices. </p><p>Help
        to Buy has so far been very successful, putting it on track to meet the government\u2019s
        target of 74,000 homes by 2016. </p><p><div class=\"add-action\"><a href=\"/en/articles/help-to-buy-schemes-faqs\">Help

        you\u2019re thinking of applying for the Help to Buy mortgage guarantee scheme,
        you\u2019ll need to consider the following: </p><ul><li>Borrowers will need
        to pass affordability checks with mortgage lenders. This varies by lender,
        but usually involves them checking that you\u2019ll still be able to meet
        payments should interest rates go up.</li><li>Borrowers will need to state
        that they have no interest in any other property worldwide, or won\u2019t
        have by the time they complete on a mortgage guarantee scheme mortgage product.</li><li>You
        may be able to apply if you''ve had minor credit problems in the past, but
        you\u2019ll still need to pass the mortgage lender\u2019s credit checks.</li><li>Borrowers
        need to have at least a 5% deposit, and be able to cover costs, for example
        Stamp Duty and any legal and valuation costs.</li><li>If you want to rent
        out the property you\u2019re going to buy, the Help to Buy schemes are not
        suitable for you.</li></ul><h2>Alternatives to Help to Buy </h2><p><div class=\"add-action\"><a

        you\u2019re thinking of applying for the Help to Buy mortgage guarantee scheme,
        you\u2019ll need to consider the following: </p><ul><li>Borrowers will need
        to pass affordability checks with mortgage lenders. This varies by lender,
        but usually involves them checking that you\u2019ll still be able to meet
        payments should interest rates go up.</li><li>Borrowers will need to state
        that they have no interest in any other property worldwide, or won\u2019t
        have by the time they complete on a mortgage guarantee scheme mortgage product.</li><li>You
        may be able to apply if you''ve had minor credit problems in the past, but
        you\u2019ll still need to pass the mortgage lender\u2019s credit checks.</li><li>Borrowers
        need to have at least a 5% deposit, and be able to cover costs, for example
        Stamp Duty and any legal and valuation costs.</li><li>If you want to rent
        out the property you\u2019re going to buy, the Help to Buy schemes are not
        suitable for you.</li></ul><h2>Alternatives to Help to Buy </h2><p><div class=\"add-action\"><a
