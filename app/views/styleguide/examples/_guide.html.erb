<h2>Help to Buy Scheme - Options (h2)</h2>

<p>Help to Buy - the two main schemes:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Equity loans</strong> - the government lends you up to a fifth of the value of a new-build home in
    England. A similar equity loan scheme is available in Scotland, for properties valued up to £400,000.
  </li>
  <li><strong>Mortgage guarantees</strong> - the government agrees to cover part of your mortgage if you only have a
    small deposit, taking on the default risk should you fall behind with payments.&nbsp;</li>
</ul>

<p>Help to Buy is expected to help make up for the lack of higher loan-to-value products available.</p>

<p>While it’s still occasionally possible for people with a deposit of only 5% to get on the property ladder, the
  government felt there should be more competition between mortgage lenders to provide greater choice to home
  buyers.</p>
