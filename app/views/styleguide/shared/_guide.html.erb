  <h2>Everything you need to know</h2>

  <p>Help to Buy - the two main schemes:</p>

  <ul>
    <li><strong>Equity loans</strong> - the government lends you up to a fifth of the value of a new-build home in
      England. A similar equity loan scheme is available in Scotland, for properties valued up to £400,000.
    </li>
    <li><strong>Mortgage guarantees</strong> - the government agrees to cover part of your mortgage if you only have a
      small deposit, taking on the default risk should you fall behind with payments.&nbsp;</li>
  </ul>

  <p>There’s an estimated £850 million lying unclaimed in lost bank accounts. If some of it’s yours, don’t let it go to
    waste!</p>

  <p>Often accounts go missing because people change their address or change names. When you search, be sure to give any
    previous names too.</p>

  <p>It’s simple and free to check whether you have long-lost bank or building society accounts or savings with National
    Savings and Investments (NS&I). You can also check online for unclaimed Premium Bond prizes.</p>

  <p>There’s a free service set up specifically to help you find lost accounts, called
    <a href="http://www.mylostaccount.org.uk">mylostaccount.org.uk</a>.</p>

  <p>The service was set up by the British Bankers’ Association, the Building Societies Association and National Savings
    and Investments (NS&I). It can help you find any lost account with any UK bank, building society or NS&I, as well as
    with some overseas banks with branches in the UK.</p>
