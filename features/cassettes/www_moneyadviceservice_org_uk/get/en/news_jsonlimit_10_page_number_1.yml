        popular times of year to be searching for holidays and no wonder - once the
        tinsel and turkey of Christmas fades, January can feel a long, grey month.
        </p><p>So it comes as no surprise that more than nine million of us were looking
        up holiday booking in January 2014, according to Google. </p><p>If you are
        thinking about booking some winter sun, or a big summer holiday to look forward
        to, stick to our simple tips to make sure your holiday is a winner, not a
        disaster. </p><h2>1.Don\u2019t overpay for your break </h2><p>When it comes
        to booking your holiday, there are a lot of options \u2013 do you want to
        go DIY and book individual parts of your trip, such as your flights and accommodation,
        yourself, or do you want to book a package? </p><p>Package holidays do tend
        to be cheaper, especially for more popular destinations, but it is worth checking
        both options as you can sometimes get a better price if you book separately.
        </p><p>As with most things, it is always best to shop around and taking the
        time to look at a few options before you get to the point of booking. </p><h2>2.Buy
        the right travel insurance </h2><p>Did you know the average cost for getting
        medical care while abroad is \u00a32040? That\u2019s according to the Association
        of British Insurers. Without insurance, you\u2019ll have to cover emergency
        expenses on your own \u2013 the British Consulate can\u2019t help you. </p><p>You
        should make sure the policy you choose is right for your needs. For example,
        you might need additional cover for winter sports, or if you have a medical
        condition, you might need specialist insurance. </p><p>There is no point hiding
        any medical conditions from your insurer either, even if it means a more expensive
        outlay in the first place. You should include everything you can, including
        any regular tablets you take. If you fail to, you could end up invalidating
        your policy. </p><p>If you are travelling in Europe, you should also get a
        European Health Insurance Card (EHIC). With an EHIC, you get the same level
        of state-provided medical care as someone who lives in the country you\u2019re
        visiting. However, the local level of care may not be the same as what you\u2019d
        get in the UK, so an EHIC is not enough on its own. You should still get travel
        insurance that includes medical and repatriation cover. </p><p>It\u2019s not
        just medical treatment. Most insurance policies will cover lost or stolen
        bags, personal liability and more. </p><p>Insurance is essential. Find out

        haul \u2013 </h3><p>Australia </p><p>Sri Lanka </p><p>South Africa </p><h2>3.Choose
        the best currency option for you </h2><p>Travelling abroad is easier within
        the EU as the currency will be Euros, but that doesn\u2019t mean there aren\u2019t
        some things you need to keep in mind when buying foreign currency \u2013 whether
        travelling in the EU or beyond. </p><p>To get the best deal for your money
        you should look up prices online and buy it in advance. Make sure when paying
        for travel money that you use a debit card or cash. Credit cards class it
        as a cash withdrawal and often charge interest and a separate fee. </p><p>The
        best exchange rates are often online, but there are pitfalls to going down
        this route. For example, you could be looking at a delivery charge of up to
        \u00a35 and you may not be given the option to choose what notes you want.
        </p><p>Taking foreign currency with you isn\u2019t the only way to pay on
        holiday though. It might be easier \u2013 and even cheaper - to use your credit
        card or debit card abroad; get a pre-paid card; or use traveller\u2019s cheques.
        Make sure you know the fees before you travel. Don\u2019t forget, some banks
        will want you to notify them of any foreign travel beforehand to monitor card
        fraud. </p><p>Find out your options with our <a title=\"Foreign currency guides\"

        you are thinking about divorcing, it can seem like a daunting time. But there
        are things you can do to make sure you are armed with the correct information
        to help tackle divorce practicalities. </p><p>Here are six things you should
        consider. </p><h2>1.Work out how much professional help you need </h2><p>Do
        you need a solicitor? The answer depends on how complicated your finances
        are \u2013 and how amicable your split is. If you part on good terms and your
        finances aren\u2019t too complicated, you don\u2019t necessarily need one.
        You could arrange everything on your own or by using an online service, if
        you live in England or Wales. </p><p>If you do need more help, you can arrange
        for advice from a solicitor or mediator and do the paperwork yourself. Find
        out more about <a title=\"Do it yourself - DIY divorce\" href=\"https://www.moneyadviceservice.org.uk/en/articles/diy-do-it-yourself-divorce-or-dissolution\">DIY
        divorce</a> with our guide. </p><h2>2.Don\u2019t bury your head in the sand
        </h2><p>It can be tempting to ignore them but short-term finances are just
        as important as long term ones. Try to reach an agreement about paying things
        such as bills as soon as you can because ignoring them could have implications
        for your credit rating or get you into debt. Plus, being able to agree on
        the smaller things puts you in a better position to reach agreement about
        the \u2018bigger\u2019 financial issues later on. </p><h2>3.Be prepared for
        the cost </h2><p>Divorce costs can be expensive, and unless you qualify for
        state help, it is something you and your ex-partner have to be prepared to
        pay for. </p><p>Whether or not you have to pay court fees will be dependent
        on your level of income and savings. Solicitor\u2019s fees can add up, but
        if you are unable to pay upfront, there are other options. You should be wary
        of taking out a high interest loan however, as you may have trouble repaying
        it at a time when you are getting used to a change in your financial situation.
        </p><p>\u00a0Let us help relieve the stress of divorce. Read our guide on
        how much <a title=\"How much divorce costs\" href=\"https://www.moneyadviceservice.org.uk/en/articles/how-much-does-divorce-or-dissolution-cost\">different
        divorce options cost</a>. </p><h2>4.Protect yourself and your finances </h2><p>Don\u2019t
        forget to think about your own finances too. You will need to act quickly
        to protect them if the divorce is acrimonious. </p><p>If the home you shared
        is registered in your ex-partner\u2019s name, you can register your interest
        to ensure it isn\u2019t sold or re-mortgaged without you being told. </p><p>However,
        you should be aware that this doesn\u2019t apply in Scotland. You have the
        right to live in the property for as long as you are married or in a civil
        partnership, but you will lose this right if you leave the property for two
        years or more. </p><h2>5.Don\u2019t ignore your full mortgage payments </h2><p>If
        you have a joint mortgage, don\u2019t forget that you are equally liable for
        the whole loan \u2013 not just repaying your half. So, if you keep up with
        your mortgage payments, but your partner doesn\u2019t, you could find that
        both your credit ratings are affected. </p><p>Equally, if you have a joint
        bank account, you should inform your bank straightaway \u2013 if your partner
        racks up any debt, you will both be liable for it. </p><p>Find out more about

        your financial assets</a>.\u00a0 </p><h2>6.Call in an impartial third party
        </h2><p>Agreeing the financial terms of a divorce can be a long process. </p><p>A
        mediator can help you and your ex-partner to reach an agreement. A solicitor
        can also help you with this process, but if you require a lot of time with
        them, it can make reaching a settlement an expensive undertaking \u2013 so
        it is best to avoid arguing with your partner through a solicitor as much
        as possible. </p>","date":"2015-01-05T10:07:30+00:00"},{"id":"new-rules-could-make-it-harder-to-get-a-payday-loan","title":"New

        lenders can make to take money from your account \u2013 both being limited
        to twice. </p><h2>How will the new payday rules affect potential borrowers?
        </h2><p>The new payday loan rules aim to increase protection for borrowers
        who are struggling to make repayments. They\u2019re intended to lower the
        cost of borrowing and increase protection for those who are at risk of escalating
        debt. </p><p>However, it\u2019s expected the limits on what lenders can charge
        could see many shut up shop, making it more difficult for some borrowers to
        find a willing lender. In fact, the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA), which
        regulates this field, estimates around 70,000 people won\u2019t be able to
        get a payday loan as a result of the rule changes. </p><h2>Payday loan brokers
        </h2><p>It\u2019s not just lenders who will need to change how they work,
        as payday loan credit brokers are also affected by the new rules. </p><p>Some
        people may have used a payday loan credit broker to help find the best loan
        for them in the past. But some of these firms haven\u2019t made it clear they
        are a credit broker and not a lender, and have been charging unauthorised
        fees for services not provided. In many cases the customer was unaware they\u2019d
        been charged. </p><p>From 2 January credit brokers are required to make it
        clear to borrowers who they are and what services that they provide, including
        a breakdown of any fees they charge.\u00a0 They also need to explain when
        these fees must be paid. </p><p>Most people don\u2019t need to use a broker
        as it\u2019s not difficult to do a little research and go directly to the
        lender. If you\u2019re planning to borrow money, remember to check if you

        love to afford next year? Is a family holiday or a new car on your radar?
        Or perhaps you\u2019d like to know how to make your savings go further? </p><p>Of
        the three in five people who made a resolution for 2014, three-quarters told
        us they\u2019d chosen to focus on money goals. </p><p>Whatever your resolution,
        our tips can help you make 2015 the year your money starts working for you.
        </p><h2>1.Make an effective budget </h2><p>To know where you can save, you
        really need to know what you spend, so budgeting is one of the most important
        things you can do to kick start your new money plans for the New Year. </p><p>Taking
        a look at your finances and finding subscriptions you can cancel, or shopping
        around to get cheaper insurance can add up to some big savings. Take a look
        at our <a title=\"Budget Planner\" href=\"https://www.moneyadviceservice.org.uk/en/tools/budget-planner\">Budget
        Planner</a> to see how you can take the first step towards better finances.
        </p><h2>2.Start saving </h2><p>When we asked members of our community, saving
        money was identified as a key goal for 2015, with people looking to save for
        a rainy day, holiday, new home or even next year''s Christmas.\u00a0 </p><p>This
        may seem challenging, but did you know that putting aside just \u00a33 a day
        adds up to \u00a31,095 over the course of a year? Put the money in a jar to
        watch it grow before your eyes \u2013 or even better, find a savings account
        that will <a title=\"Savings accounts\" href=\"https://www.moneyadviceservice.org.uk/en/articles/regular-savings-accounts\">help
        boost your money</a>. </p><p>Not sure how to find that \u00a33? Well, could
        you get your caffeine fix by filling a Thermos at home, or walk to work instead
        of taking the bus? See our <a title=\"Cut Back Calculator\" href=\"https://www.moneyadviceservice.org.uk/en/tools/cut-back-calculator\">Cut
        Back Calculator</a> to find out where else you could cut back. The tool only
        takes five minutes to complete, but you could be rewarded with a nice boost
        in your savings. </p><h2>3.Take advantage of the increased cash ISAs allowance
        </h2><p>On 1 July 2014, Cash ISAs (Individual Savings Accounts) and Stocks
        and Shares ISAs were merged and renamed New ISAs \u2013 or NISAs with an increased
        allowance limit of \u00a315,000. If you haven\u2019t already taken advantage
        of your full allowance you have until April 5th 2015 to either open a new
        or put money into an existing ISA and take advantage of any tax free interest
        on your savings. </p><p>Next year\u2019s ISA allowance is being increased
        to \u00a315,240 from April 6th. However, watch out for teaser rates that lure
        you in only to drop after the introductory period, and do shop around to find
        the best available rates. </p><p>It always a good idea to set up a reminder
        to notify you when any bonus rate runs out to maximise your ISA returns. </p><h2>4.Check
        your credit report </h2><p>Struggling to get credit from your bank or a lender?
        It could have something to do with your credit report. A credit report details
        your credit history, including a list of all your accounts, and helps a company
        assess how risky it would be to lend to you. </p><p>Our research has shown
        two in three UK adults have never checked their credit report. </p><p>We asked
        our Tell MA Community about their experiences with credit reports. Many people
        didn\u2019t know credit ratings can also affect bank accounts, interest rates,
        utility provider applications and mobile phone contracts. One person said
        <em>\u2018Credit and credit ratings are a bit of a mystery to me. It\u2019s
        something other people worry about.\u2019</em></p><p>Find out <a title=\"How
        to check your credit report\" href=\"https://www.moneyadviceservice.org.uk/en/articles/how-to-check-your-credit-report\">how

        to improve your credit score</a>. </p><h2>5.Give up smoking </h2><p>If you\u2019ve
        tried \u2013 and failed \u2013 to quit before, maybe money can be the motivation
        you need? According to Ash.org a 20-a-day smoker of a premium cigarette brand
        will spend about \u00a32,900 a year on cigarettes. </p><p>If cigarettes are
        burning a hole in your budget, why don\u2019t you set yourself a savings goal
        to work towards? If you take out the money you spend on cigarettes from your
        outgoings, you\u2019re much more likely to reach your goal quickly. See our
        <a title=\"Set a savings goal guide\" href=\"https://www.moneyadviceservice.org.uk/en/articles/how-to-set-a-savings-goal\">guide
        on starting a savings goal</a>. </p><p>You\u2019ll be amazed how much daily
        costs add up over time. And that extra cash could be working hard for you
        in a savings account or a pension pot instead of being smoked away. </p><p>Giving
        up smoking can be hard. For tips on how to give up, visit <a title=\"NHS Smokefree\"

        half (47%) of those plan to buy cheaper alternatives to their usual products.

        you receive a present for Christmas that was a bit of a flop? Or something
        that you already have?","body":"<p class=\"intro\"> Did you receive a present
        for Christmas that was a bit of a flop? Or something that you already have?
        </p><p>According to our annual Christmas spending survey, 37% of UK adults
        received presents last year they didn\u2019t want or haven\u2019t used \u2013
        worth an average of \u00a354.21. </p><p>But stashing unwanted gifts in the
        back of the wardrobe and forgetting about them means you could be missing
        out. Most retailers have return policies \u2013 and if the item was bought
        online, they are obligated by law to provide one. Plus, the quicker you act
        the more likely it is you will be covered by return policies, and it\u2019s
        less likely that you will forget about it too. </p><h2>Taking presents back
        to a shop </h2><p>Did you know that high street shops don\u2019t have to accept
        non-faulty returns? But if they have a returns policy, they must stick to
        it. Check out the retailer\u2019s website or the back of receipts to see how
        long you have to return the item. </p><p>You might not be able to get your
        money back though. Return policies may\u00a0offer different ways of refunding
        you, including cash, exchange of goods or credit notes to buy other goods
        from the same retailer. </p><p>Where possible, keep the receipt and all packaging
        when you buy something. </p><h2>Online returns \u2013 why it\u2019s worth
        the hassle of returns </h2><p>In our survey on online shopping earlier this
        year, more than half of shoppers said they were less likely to return <a title=\"Tips

        bought online</a>. Most said it was \u201ctoo much hassle\u201d to go to the
        effort of posting the item back. A total of 84% admitted they \u201cdon''t
        completely understand\u201d returns rules. </p><p>But you have more rights
        to return when you buy online, as you''re not able to physically check out
        the product before you buy it. </p><p>The <a title=\"Knowing your consumer

        Contracts Regulations 2013</a> allow you to return (most) goods ordered at
        a distance \u2013 which means online, over the phone or via a catalogue. </p><p>There
        are a few exceptions to this rule. These include CDs, DVDs or software if
        you''ve broken the seal on the wrapping, perishable items, tailor-made or
        personalised items. </p><p>You have 14 days from receiving the item to return
        it. The retailer should refund you within 14 days of receiving the goods or
        getting proof you have returned them \u2013 whichever is sooner. </p><p>Remember
        this is the minimum online retailers should give you \u2013 and if their website
        offers a longer policy, they must stick to it. </p><h2>It was a present, I
        don\u2019t have the receipt! </h2><p>If you wish to return a present, you''ll
        need proof of purchase. The best way to do this is with a gift receipt, which
        doesn''t show how much the item cost. </p><p>If you weren\u2019t given one
        with your gift, you\u2019ll need to ask for the receipt from the person who
        bought it for you. </p><p>This does have the potential to be awkward, but
        it\u2019s better than having a present you won\u2019t use. </p><p>Still too
        much hassle to return? According to a Mintel report in January 2014, 5.5%
        of people sold their unwanted gifts on eBay, so you could think about selling

        basic bank account? </h2><p>If you have financial difficulties such as a poor
        credit rating, you might not be able to open a standard bank account - and
        that''s where basic accounts come in. </p><p>Basic bank accounts are generally
        simple, as they don\u2019t offer an overdraft facility or cheque book. </p><p>With
        most accounts, you can deposit funds such as wages, salary, pensions and cheques
        for free; get money out over the counter or at an ATM; and pay your bills
        by Direct Debit or standing order. </p><p>As long as you have money in your
        account, you don\u2019t usually have to pay for basic bank account services.
        </p><h2>2. How to get a basic bank account - the eligibility factor </h2><p>To
        get a basic bank account you have to be over 16 and have proof of identity
        and address. Some banks will only accept photo ID. </p><p>A basic bank account
        should be provided to any customer who isn''t able to open a standard account,

        a standing order or Direct Debit the bank can refuse to pay it \u2013 and
        you may be charged as much as \u00a325 each time a payment is refused. </p><p>Before
        you get a basic bank account, make sure it offers the services you need \u2013
        such as a debit card, Direct Debits or standing orders. You should also check
