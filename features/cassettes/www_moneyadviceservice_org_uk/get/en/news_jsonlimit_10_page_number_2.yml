        Weather Payment system. </p><p>These \u00a325 payments are made for every
        seven-day period of very cold weather in your region between 1 November and
        31 March each year. </p><p>If you receive income-related benefits you may

        </p><p>Last year only one seven-day period of freezing weather was recorded
        by one of the 92 weather stations, at Braemar in Scotland, according to Gov.uk.

        area of the Highlands, adding up to \u00a325,700 over the 2013 to 2014 winter.
        </p><p>But the previous year there were almost 6million payouts, adding up
        to more than \u00a3145million. </p><h2>How to find out if you are entitled
        to Cold Weather Payments </h2><p>You may be eligible for a Cold Weather Payment
        if you are getting a Pension Credit, Income Support, income-based Jobseeker\u2019s
        Allowance, income-related Employment and Support Allowance or Universal Credit.

        tops the list with 11, and just two of rest were located outside Scotland,
        at Shap in Cumbria and Fylingdales in North Yorkshire. </p><h2>What\u2019s
        the Winter Fuel Payment? </h2><p>Don\u2019t confuse Cold Weather Payments
        with the Winter Fuel Payment, which is a one-off payment made each year to
        help eligible people pay for their heating in the winter. </p><p>It\u2019s
        usually given to people who get the State Pension or another social security
        benefit. </p><p>Most payments for this are automatic too, and worth between
        \u00a3100 to \u00a3300. </p><h2>Take action: Preparing for a cold snap </h2><p>Making
        sure you are maximising your income is one way you can help stave off the
        cold when it hits. If temperatures drop, but not consistently enough for you
        to receive a Cold Weather Payment, knowing you have some money put aside that
        you could draw on to pay for gas or electricity will make all the difference.

        Duty </h2><p>The biggest change is to Stamp Duty, which you pay when you buy
        a home. Until now you''ve paid stamp duty on the total purchase price of your
        new home, but now home buyers will be charged in a similar way to income tax.\u00a0
        </p><p>So, if you buy a home costing more than \u00a3125,000 you will pay
        no tax on the first \u00a3125,000 and 2% on the portion up to \u00a3250,000.
        The rate you pay increases on subsequent chunks as the value goes up. Previously
        the homeowner would pay 1% on the total up to \u00a3250,000, or more if the
        property value was higher.\u00a0 </p><p>As with the old system, higher rates
        apply as the price of the property increases through different bands. But
        instead of the rate applying to the whole value of the property,\u00a0it will
        only apply to the chunk of the selling price that falls into each tax band.\u00a0
        </p><p>The Treasury estimates 98% of people who buy a home will pay less stamp
        duty. </p><p>Anyone who has exchanged contracts by 3 December, but not completed,
        can choose to pay under the old system or the new one.\u00a0 </p><p><img src=\"/images/15936361772_d3a2012747_z.jpg\"/>\u00a0

        Junior ISAs and Child Trust Funds are also rising, to \u00a34,080. </p><p>Another
        change means savings and investments held in the account of an ISA holder
        who dies can be transferred to their spouse or civil partner\u2019s ISA, so

        three things you need to know about financing a new car","description":"More
        new cars than ever are being bought on finance","body":"<p class=\"intro\">The
        bulk of cars bought in the UK are used, but there are still more than one
        million brand new registration vehicles sold every year \u2013 and more than
        ever are being bought on finance. </p><p>Of course buying a new car is more
        expensive , so it\u2019s no wonder people look at options to help spread the
        cost. This year saw the highest number of cars bought on finance \u2013 75.8%,
        up by 12% from last year \u2013 according to figures from the Finance &amp;
        Leasing Association. That\u2019s worth \u00a313.7 billion pounds. </p><p>If
        you\u2019re thinking of buying a new car and can\u2019t pay cash, here are
        three things you need to know about financing. </p><h2>1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0There\u2019s
        more than one way to get finance </h2><p>Hire purchase (HP) is often the simplest
        car finance plan. You\u2019re hiring the car until you\u2019ve paid the full
        amount. These plans can be quite flexible, with terms of one to five years
        commonly available. Of course the longer you spread the payments, the more
        the car will cost. </p><p>You can borrow money in other ways too. Personal
        loans are often the cheapest way to borrow in the long term. Use the Annual
        Percentage Rate (APR) charged for the borrowing to compare interest and get
        an idea of which is the best deal. </p><p>Another option is a PCP - or a personal
        contract purchase. This is leasing with an option to buy the car at the end
        for an additional amount. Monthly payments are often lower. </p><p><a data-type=\"action\"

        don\u2019t have the same rights as buying with cash </h2><p>With HP, if you
        get into financial difficulties and can\u2019t afford the repayments, the
        finance company could take the car away from you. And if this happens before
        you\u2019ve paid a third of the total due, your car can be repossessed without
        a court order. Double check there are no penalties for paying it off early
        either and make sure you understand what will happen if you miss a payment.
        </p><p>You also can\u2019t sell the car when you want as it\u2019s not yours
        until all payments have been made, and you need to let the finance company
        know if you want to take the car abroad. </p><h2>3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0You
        can shop around for the best deals </h2><p>Just because your dealer is offering
        one finance package, you don\u2019t have to take it. It\u2019s a good idea
        to shop around many other brokers to see if they can do any better. </p><p>The
        better your credit rating, the lower interest rate deal you\u2019ll be able
        to get. </p><p><a data-type=\"action\" hreflang=\"en\" href=\"/content/tools/car-costs-calculator\">Before

        in one go nearer the time. </p><p>But watch out. Getting stocked up on crackers
        and cranberry sauce isn\u2019t going to be a problem, but that sweater for
        uncle Frank which turns out to be the wrong size could be an issue if the
        date for returns has passed by the time he\u2019s opened it up on Christmas
        morning. </p><h2>Deadlines for returns could catch you out </h2><p>While UK
        consumer law means retailers have to let you return most purchases, the timescales
        do vary and the deadlines could catch you out if it turns out something needs
        to go back to the shop. </p><p>Under the <a title=\"Your rights\" href=\"https://www.moneyadviceservice.org.uk/en/news/protect-against-unexpected-costs-by-knowing-your-consumer-rights\">Consumer

        unused items within 14 days of buying them or having them delivered. </p><p>If
        you made the purchase online or over the phone you have a further 14 days
        from the day you contacted the retailer to cancel in which to return the purchase.
        </p><p>With purchases you make online or over the phone, yet pick up in store,\u00a0you
        can just return the item within the initial 14 days, or if you can''t get
        to the store within this period, call them to cancel and arrange for a postal
        return.\u00a0 </p><p>Tailored or personalised items (such as engraved jewellery,
        earrings and tickets for events) are not covered by these rules. </p><h2>Great

        major retailers\u2019 policies and we found all at least met the legal requirements
        when it came to returns, with several such as M&amp;S, Debenhams and GAP offering
        longer than the required period to return. </p><p>In some cases retailers
        will extend their returns deadlines around the Christmas period, but they

        check with your friends and relatives before buying expensive presents, make
        sure you\u2019ve bagged specific purchases so you don''t double up \u2013
        especially if you\u2019re looking to purchase them early. </p><p>\u2022\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Shop
        around for the cheapest, reputable seller. There are some less-than reliable
        firms out there, and you don\u2019t want to end up waiting until after Christmas
        for deliveries (especially if you could have bought them in the sales). </p><p>\u2022\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0If
        you have to return an online product, inform the retailer in writing (if possible).

        retailers will offer a credit note when you could be entitled to a cash refund

        are four key differences between store cards and loyalty cards so you can
        spot the difference","body":"<p class=\"intro\">When you\u2019re out shopping,
        have you been asked at the checkout if you\u2019d like to sign up to the store\u2019s
        membership card? You might get a discount there and then, or the chance to
        earn points and other rewards. It can seem like a great way to save, but it\u2019s
        not always money for nothing. </p><p>In reality you might be picking up a
        store card rather than a loyalty card. With a store card you could be entering
        into a credit agreement, with high interest rates, charges and the potential
        to get into debt. </p><p>Store cards are often sold by sales assistants rather
        than financial experts, sothe focus tends to be on the offers you\u2019ll
        get, and not the possible cost implications \u2013 and that can come at a
        high cost . </p><p>So how to do you know what you\u2019re being offered? Here
        are four key differences between store cards and loyalty cards so you can
        spot the difference. </p><h2>Four differences between store cards and loyalty
        cards\u00a0 </h2><p>1. \u00a0 \u00a0<strong>A store card works like a credit
        card</strong> you can only use in one shop or chain. Watch out for words or
        phrases such as \u201ccredit\u201d, \u201cmonthly payments\u201d, \u201cAPR\u201d,
        \u201cBuy now, pay later\u201d or anything else that suggests you\u2019re
        borrowing money. </p><p>2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0<strong>You don\u2019t need
        to apply for a loyalty card</strong>. In fact you will probably be able to
        just pick up a temporary card and send in the form to register it. But store
        cards will have an application form to fill in before you can get the discount.
        Read any small print to be sure before signing anything. If you do hand in
        the form, a credit check will be made which can affect your credit report,
        especially if you are rejected . </p><p>3. \u00a0 <strong>You pay for the
        purchases with a store card</strong>, but loyalty cards can only be used to
        pay for goods when you\u2019ve earned enough points. You\u2019ll also be charged
        interest on store card purchases - so if you don\u2019t pay back the full
        amount each month you\u2019ll be hit with extra charges. </p><p>4. \u00a0
        <strong>Store card discounts will probably be big and one off</strong>, while
        loyalty cards earn smaller rewards over time. So if it says \u201csave 10%
        on your first purchase\u201d, there\u2019s a good chance it\u2019s a store
        card. </p><p><a data-type=\"action\" hreflang=\"en\" href=\"/content/guides/store-cards-explained\">Read

        costs: Check your consumer rights before paying the bill","description":"It''s
        important to know whether you can draw on your legal rights before dipping
        into your pocket.","body":"<p class=\"intro\"> Unexpected costs set most households
        back an average of \u00a31,101 in the past year \u2013 so it''s important
        to know whether you can draw on your legal rights before dipping into your
        pocket. </p><p>Money Advice Service findings reveal saving \u00a33 a day over
        a year - a total of \u00a31,095 - would cover most of the typical unexpected
        costs we might need to pay for over 12 months. </p><p>However, before\u00a0using
        your\u00a0savings, or drawing on credit to pay the bill, it is worth checking
        out your consumer rights. </p><h2>Your rights to return goods </h2><p>Knowing
        your rights when purchases don\u2019t live up to expectations can help prevent
        unexpected costs. Under the Sale of Goods Act 1979\u00a0purchases must be:
        </p><ul><li><strong>Fit for purpose</strong> \u2013 They must meet reasonable
        expectations, and be suitable for any requirements that you point out to the
        retailer when buying. For instance, if you are buying boots for hiking, they
        must be robust and waterproof if you make this need clear in a face-to-face
        conversation.</li><li><strong>Of satisfactory quality</strong> \u2013 Goods
        and services must be of a standard a reasonable person would regard as satisfactory,
        taking into account any description given of them</li><li><strong>As described</strong>
        \u2013 Whether you buy in-store, online or over the phone you have the right
        to expect your purchase to match the retailer\u2019s description.</li></ul><h2>A
        reasonable life-cycle </h2><p>Retailers may be obliged to refund or replace
        a purchase if it\u2019s reasonable to expect the product to last for longer
        than a certain period of time. For example, it\u2019s reasonable to expect
        a \u00a350 kettle to last longer than a \u00a35 model. </p><h2>Sale of goods
        exceptions </h2><p>It\u2019s worth noting the Sale of Goods Act won\u2019t
        cover all problems, which is why regular savings could help you avoid unnecessary
        stress. For example, you can\u2019t fall back on it if: </p><ul><li>The retailer
        pointed out any fault with the purchase before you paid</li><li>The fault
        was obvious and you had a reasonable chance to examine the item before buying</li><li>You
        subsequently change your mind about the purchase, such as if it is the wrong
        colour or size</li><li>You damage the goods.</li></ul><h2>Buying and returning
        goods </h2><p>You may have certain rights when buying items or services online
        or over the phone, which could help you avoid spending some of your emergency
        savings. </p><p>These rights are covered by the Consumer Contracts (Information,
        cancellation and Additional Charges)\u00a0Regulations 2013. Basically, they
        require retailers to describe\u00a0the product you are buying, include the
        total cost (including any delivery and returns costs), and rights to cancel.
        </p><p>If you want to cancel an order you\u2019re allowed to: </p><ul><li>from
        the day you placed it until 14 days from the date you receive it.</li><li>return
        any cancelled goods within 14 days</li><li>you don\u2019t have to give a reason
        for your decision.\u00a0</li></ul><h2>Where you are not covered </h2><p>Certain
        goods and services aren\u2019t covered under the regulations. Some of these
        include: </p><ul><li>Personalised items, such as engraved jewellery, tailored
        suits and fitted kitchens</li><li>Financial products and services</li><li>Earrings,
        underwear, and other items that might pose a health and safety risk, and can\u2019t
        be resold.</li></ul><h2>Not what you expected? </h2><p>Sometimes the problem
        with a purchase is that it was mis-sold. If this is the case, you may be able
        to use the Consumer Protection from Unfair Trading Regulations 1998. This
        regulation covers you if something you were sold was described in a misleading
        way or an important fact was omitted. </p><h2>Card payments </h2><p>If you
        haven\u2019t been able to resolve your problem after contacting the retailer
        it\u2019s worth speaking to your payment card provider. If the purchase was
        between \u00a3100 and \u00a330,000, and all or part of the payment was made
        on a credit card, <a title=\"Section 75 protection\" href=\"https://www.moneyadviceservice.org.uk/en/articles/how-youre-protected-when-you-pay-by-card\">Section
        75 of the Consumer Credit Act 1974</a> can help. </p><p>If you spent less
        than \u00a3100 on a credit card or paid by debit card you can apply to your
        card provider for a refund under the Visa or MasterCard Chargeback scheme.
        </p><p>Knowledge of these rights and laws may help you avoid dipping into
        your emergency savings to cover unexpected costs. </p><h2>Find out more </h2><p>Visit
