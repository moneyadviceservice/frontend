        closer you get to retirement, the less room for manoeuvre you have in terms
        of filling any gap in your pension savings. But there may still be steps you
        can take to help generate the kind of income you hope to retire on. </p><div

        class=\"collapsable\"><div class=\"why\"><h4>Why? </h4><p>Tax relief can add
        a significant boost to any extra contributions you make to your pension before
        retirement. This is particularly true if you pay higher-rate Income Tax. </p></div><div

        Defer retirement </h3><div class=\"collapsable\"><div class=\"why\"><h4>Why?
        </h4><p>Deferring your pension means you have more time to contribute to it,
        it stays invested for longer and you won''t need it to cover as many years
        of retirement. </p></div><div class=\"how\"><h4>How? </h4><ul><li><a href=\"https://www.moneyadviceservice.org.uk/en/action_plans/decide-when-to-take-your-pension\">Follow

        class=\"collapsable\"><div class=\"why\"><h4>Why? </h4><p>Your State Pension
        depends on how many years of National Insurance contributions you''ve built
        up. But you can make extra contributions to fill in any ''missing'' years.

        provider offers in return for your pension pot before you''ve shopped around.
        It can add 20% or more to your retirement income. </p></div><div class=\"how\"><h4>How?
