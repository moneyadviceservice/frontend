  body: "<p> A good credit report could be your ticket to better lending, so it's important to keep track of it and know how to improve your score. </p><p>But new Money Advice Service research shows that not only are too few people checking theirs, many don't know exactly what they are used for.  </p><p>Credit reference agencies produce the reports to be used by lenders to rate the credit worthiness of an individual - put simply, the better your credit rating the lower the risk you will default on any existing or future credit obligations.
