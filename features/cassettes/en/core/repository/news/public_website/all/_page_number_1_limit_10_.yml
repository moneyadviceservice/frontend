        can sometimes be cheaper to get the train to Paris than to Leeds. But a few
        simple tricks should help cut the price of travelling by train in the UK.
        </p><p>We show you exactly how much ten tricks reduce prices on different
        routes. Next time you book a ticket, try them out to see what you can save.
        </p><h2>1)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Big savings when you buy in advance </h2><p>Travelling
        from London to Manchester between 5pm and 6pm can be expensive. Buying your
        ticket on the day would cost you \u00a3160.50. </p><p>Buy it four weeks ahead
        and the same trains were \u00a3113. And if you can plan three months in advance,
        the lowest fare is \u00a335.50. </p><p><strong>So on this route, booking three
        months in advance would SAVE \u00a3125. </strong></p><h2>2)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Lower
        the price by going later </h2><p>Just by taking the train three hours later
        on the same London to Manchester route, you could get a ticket for \u00a378.70
        (on the day) or \u00a312.50 (three months in advance). </p><p><strong>That\u2019s
        a SAVING of \u00a381.80 on the day.</strong></p><h2>3)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Split
        your ticket, stay in your seat </h2><p>It\u2019s a long journey from Birmingham
        to Plymouth, and quite expensive. But often trains are cheaper if you split
        up your journey buying two or three tickets for different stages of the journey.
        You often don\u2019t even need to change trains. </p><p>If you bought a single
        direct ticket on the day it would cost \u00a3111.90. But if you bought a ticket
        from Birmingham to Exeter, and another from Exeter to Plymouth for the very
        same train, the total would be \u00a390.60 </p><p><strong>Spliting tickets
        but not the train to Plymouth would SAVE \u00a321.30. </strong></p><h2>4)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Change
        the start station, change the fare </h2><p>Travel from London to Birmingham
        normally goes from Euston to New Street and could cost \u00a382 for travel
        on the day. But if you\u2019re prepared to go from London Marylebone to Birmingham
        Moor Street, you\u2019d cut the fare by more than half to \u00a340. They\u2019re
        both central stations. </p><p><strong>\u00a342.50 SAVED for an extra 10 minutes
        trip.</strong></p><h2>5)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0More haste, less savings </h2><p>Take
        the stopping train from London Euston to Birmingham New Street, and it\u2019s
        just \u00a327.50. This train does take 40 minutes more than the fastest option,
        but if you\u2019re not in rush it could be worth it. </p><p><strong>Taking
        your time to get to Birmingham would SAVE as much as \u00a354.50.</strong></p><h2>6)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Young?
        Old? In a couple? Save with a railcard </h2><p>Leeds to Edinburgh on the day
        could cost \u00a394.30. A valid railcard costs \u00a330 for the year and brings
        the fare down by a third to \u00a362.25. </p><p><strong>Eligible railcards
        would SAVE \u00a332.05 on this journey.</strong></p><h2>7)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Check
        if two singles are cheaper </h2><p>It seems like a strange idea but sometimes
        two singles are often cheaper than a return, particularly if you\u2019re getting
        advance or off peak tickets. Travelling from Manchester to Cardiff has a standard
        off-peak return price of \u00a380. Getting two singles in a month\u2019s time
        would be \u00a334. </p><p><strong> Checking the price of singles vs a return
        would SAVE \u00a346.</strong></p><h2>8)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Get on the
        right train \u2013 it\u2019s expensive to pay twice! </h2><p>There were tickets
        as cheap as \u00a36 to travel from Birmingham to London Marylebone. But they\u2019re
        for a specific train on a specific route. If you didn\u2019t realise and got
        a different train, conductors would probably make you buy a new ticket at
        full price\u2013 a staggering \u00a382. </p><p><strong>Not travelling on the
        train booked would cost you and extra \u00a382. </strong></p><h2>9)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Don\u2019t
        get derailed by extra fees </h2><p>Some sites will have a booking fee and
        a charge for using a credit card. Going via the train provider\u2019s own
        websites shouldn\u2019t cost you more. </p><p><strong>Fees on some of the
        routes above were as much as \u00a34, potentially more.</strong></p><h2>10)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a01st
        class might be first for value </h2><p>If advance tickets are already sold
        out in standard class, you might find it cheaper to go by 1st. On an afternoon
        trip from Newcastle to Glasgow, the standard single was \u00a339.50, but 1st
        class on the same train was \u00a331.70. </p><p><strong>So, you could SAVE
        \u00a37.70 and have a comfier journey by travelling in first class on some
        journeys.</strong></p><p>Read our guide for more ways to<a title=\"Cut your

        of goods you might want to avoid, unless you are sure you\u2019ll enjoy the
        benefits. </p><h2>Mobile phone insurance </h2><p>Mobile phone insurance could
        be a waste of money if you don\u2019t have a history of losing your handset
        or your phone is cheap. That\u2019s because mobile phone cover can cost anything
        from \u00a316 to \u00a3300 a year. </p><p>However, it may be worth considering
        if you have an expensive phone or are locked into a long-term contract. If
        you couldn''t afford to replace your phone without insuring it, consider starting
        to save to replace it. </p><p>Also your phone could be included in your home
        insurance policy. There is usually no point in doubling up on insurance (as
        you could only draw on one policy for an individual claim). </p><p>On the
        other hand, the high excesses on home insurance \u2013 you typically have
        to pay the first \u00a350 to \u00a3100 of a claim \u2013 and the damage to
        your no claims bonus could make mobile phone insurance worthwhile. If you
        can\u2019t live without your phone, look at how quickly your home insurer
        will replace it as they may be slower. </p><p>If you are unsure, see our guide

        title=\"Extended warranties\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.moneyadviceservice.org.uk/en/articles/extended-warranties-are-they-worth-it\">Extended
        warranties</a> cover repair costs, usually on white goods, after the retailer\u2019s
        guarantee lapses. They typically last for between one and five years depending
        on the purchase price of the item being protected, and they are expensive.
        </p><p>For example, a five-year extended warranty on a \u00a3449 TV could
        cost nearly \u00a3150. But as a consumer you have rights to protect you against
        faulty purchases. </p><p>If the goods you bought are faulty, you\u2019re covered
        by the 1979 Sale of Goods Act. This says that goods sold should be of satisfactory
        quality, fit for purpose and last for a reasonable time. If they are not,
        you can return them and ask for a refund or replacement. </p><p>Provided the
        cause isn\u2019t reasonable wear and tear, you are within your rights to return
        goods up to six years after you bought them. </p><h2>ID theft insurance </h2><p>ID
        theft insurance can cost around \u00a310 a year. This may seem a small sum
        for peace of mind. </p><p>But you are already covered for any financial loss
        if your identity is used fraudulently by your bank or credit card provider.
        For a claim to be rejected your provider must prove you were grossly negligent
        or committed fraud. </p><p>The provider can withhold the first \u00a350 of
        any loss, but they invariably waive this \u2013 so you shouldn\u2019t be left
        out of pocket. </p><p>It\u2019s also worth noting that Visit our <a title=\"ID

        out a <a title=\"Store cards explained\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.moneyadviceservice.org.uk/en/articles/store-cards-explained\">store
        card</a>. These are credit cards branded to specific shops, and offer incentives
        such as a discount off your initial purchase, freebees and exclusive offers.
        </p><p>As long as they don\u2019t tempt you to overspend and you pay your
        bill off in full on time, they\u2019re fine. However, you will pay very high
        interest rates if you don\u2019t clear your balance each month. </p><p>The
        Money Advice Service estimates that some store cards charge twice as much
        interest as credit cards. So, a 10% sign-up discount could cost you more in
        the long run. </p><h2>Packaged bank accounts </h2><p>You can pay around \u00a315
        a month for a <a title=\"Packaged accounts\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.moneyadviceservice.org.uk/en/articles/packaged-accounts\">packaged
        account</a>, which provides a range of extra features, such as free travel
        insurance, mobile phone cover or better exchange rates. </p><p>However, if
        you don\u2019t expect to use these benefits, it\u2019s an expensive option.
        If you do want some of these extras, you may be able to buy them cheaper separately.
        </p><p>You also need to check the terms and conditions for exclusions and
        excesses. For instance, many accounts won\u2019t cover you under their travel
        insurance element if you are over 70 or 75. </p>","date":"2014-07-18T09:29:58+00:00"},{"id":"from-civil-war-to-sonic-booms-unexpected-insurance-exclusions-explained","title":"From

        expect a claim to be turned down if your car isn\u2019t taxed, but what about
        if your car is damaged by a falling coconut? </p><p>There is a reason why
        insurance policy documents never appear on the bestseller lists. They are
        frequently long and very dry. However, it\u2019s worth taking time to understand
        what is and isn\u2019t included, especially when compared with the considerable
        hassle of having to make a claim that gets turned down at a later stage.\u00a0
        </p><h2>Quirky insurance clauses </h2><p>Some surprising exclusions are industry
        wide, others feature on only some policies. Here are some of the more unexpected
        exclusions we found in insurance policies: </p><h2>Within arms\u2019 length
        </h2><p>You\u2019d think one of the main points of having a <a title=\"Do
        you need mobile phone insurance?\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.moneyadviceservice.org.uk/en/articles/do-you-need-mobile-phone-insurance\">policy
        covering mobile phones</a> would be to protect against theft when you\u2019re
        out and about. But, if you knowingly leave your mobile out of reach at any
        time you\u2019re likely to have any claim for theft rejected. </p><h2>Airmiles
        and timeshare problems </h2><p>Some <a title=\"Good travel insurance policies\"
        target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.moneyadviceservice.org.uk/en/articles/a-good-travel-insurance-policy\">travel
        policy</a> providers will not cover you for unused trips or accommodation
        booked using airline mileage or similar reward schemes.\u00a0 Some will pay
        up if you can prove the schemes have a specific monetary value. Likewise,
        some insurers will turn down claims relating to timeshare fees, such as management,
        maintenance and exchange costs.\u00a0 </p><h2>Valet parking </h2><p>Recent
        research reveals around half of <a title=\"Car insurance - choose the right
        level of cover\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.moneyadviceservice.org.uk/en/articles/car-insurance-choose-the-right-level-of-cover\">car
        insurance policies</a> won\u2019t pay up if you hand your car keys to a valet
        parking service and it\u2019s subsequently damaged. This includes parking
        services at airports and hotels. </p><h2>Burglar alarms </h2><p>Many home
        <a title=\"Contents insurance\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.moneyadviceservice.org.uk/en/articles/contents-insurance-get-the-right-policy-and-cover\">contents
        insurance</a> policies won\u2019t pay a burglary-related claim if you tell
        your insurer you have an alarm, but don\u2019t use it when away from home.
        Some will reject claims where the alarm is not set up to cover unoccupied
        rooms when you\u2019re asleep. They can do this if the policy states the alarm
        must be activated in these circumstances. </p><h2>Low flying planes </h2><p>Many
        home <a title=\"Buildings insurance\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.moneyadviceservice.org.uk/en/articles/buildings-insurance-what-does-a-good-policy-look-like\">buildings
        insurance</a> and car insurance\u00a0will exclude damage caused by sonic booms
        from low flying aircraft. These are pressure waves from aircraft travelling
        at or above the speed of sound. </p><p>Although Concorde is no longer flying,
        military aircraft do crisscross the skies in some areas of the country, so
        this could be an issue if you live in the vicinity of an RAF base or under
        a regularly-used flight path. </p><h2>Falling coconuts </h2><p>If you\u2019re
        travelling to a tropical destination and hire a car, be careful where you
        park. Many standard <a title=\"Car insurance when driving abroad\" target=\"_blank\"
        href=\"https://www.moneyadviceservice.org.uk/en/articles/car-insurance-when-driving-abroad\">car
        hire policies</a> will exclude damage caused by falling coconuts. If this
        sounds strange, remember that coconuts grow in abundance in the Caribbean,
        Cook Islands and Polynesia among other places and it\u2019s tempting to park
        in the shade of a coconut tree.\u00a0 </p><p>Check your policy (when you pick
        up your car at the local depot) and upgrade to one that will protect against
        this surprisingly common cause of claims. </p><h2>What you can do </h2><p>Some
        of these exclusions are so unlikely that it\u2019s probably not worth worrying
        about, as is the case with nuclear explosions or invasions, and in any event
        you\u2019d probably struggle to get insured for anywhere near a reasonable
        sum. </p><p>Others are worth scrutinising the small print for and either shopping
        around or asking your insurance for an upgrade, as could be the case if you\u2019re
        visiting coconut territory. </p><p>In any event, always read policy terms
        and conditions before signing on the dotted line, and speak to the insurer
        if you have a query. </p><p><em>Photo: PA</em></p>","date":"2014-07-18T09:29:21+00:00"},{"id":"can-you-afford-a-mortgage-try-our-new-calculator","title":"Can

        As motoring costs spiral, making savings wherever you can is more important
        than ever. </p><p>Paying little or no road tax is one area you could consider
        when buying your next car, and you don\u2019t have to buy a small electric
        city car to avoid paying tax - there\u2019s more choice than you think. </p><p>Road
        tax, or vehicle excise duty (VED), depends on how environmentally-friendly
        a car is. It is based on how many grams of carbon dioxide (CO2) it emits per
        kilometre driven. </p><p>There are 13 tax bands with costs ranging from \u00a30
        (for Band A cars) to \u00a31,090 for Band M* gas-guzzlers (\u00a3500pa from
        year 2). </p><p>Band A (CO2 emissions up to and including 100g/km) is packed
        with pure electric cars such as the Nissan Leaf, Renault Zoe, Volkswagen e-UP!
        And the BMW i3, but there are a few surprises too. </p><p>Read our guide <a

        tax bands explained</a></p><h2>More miles per gallon from plug-in hybrids
        </h2><p>Band A also includes hybrids (cars that combine a conventional petrol
        or diesel engine with an electric motor). </p><p>You may be surprised to learn
        that a large luxury car like the \u00a389,3278 Porsche Panamera 3.0 S E-Hybrid
        Tiptronic S (includes \u00a35,000 government plug-in car grant) qualifies
        for \u00a30 car tax. </p><p>The big 4x4 Mitsubishi Outlander PHEV 2.0 GX3h
        Auto, another plug-in hybrid, also fits into Band A. </p><p><img src=\"/images/porsche_panamera_hybrid_new_size.jpg\"/>However,
        it\u2019s worth delving into the detail and looking at the total cost of motoring
        for any new car before splashing out. </p><p>Use our simple <a title=\"Car

        of Motoring tool</a>. </p><p>For instance, the Porsche Panamera has a range
        of up to 22 miles when relying on electric power, but may only do around 30-40mpg
        when running on petrol.\u00a0 </p><p>The Panamera is also in the highest insurance
        group and will depreciate by as much as 50% after three years based on driving
        10,000 miles a year, according to\u00a0Parkers.co.uk. </p><p>Read our guide

        can run on pure electric for 32.5 miles. </p><p>However, the miles per gallon
        will drop to closer to 40 when the 2.0-litre petrol engine is used, while

        loans are designed to give people some extra cash to tide them over for a

        ways to pay for your new car","description":"Your options for financing a
        new set of wheels","body":"<p class=\"intro\"> New car sales in the UK are
        rising and the new \u201c14\u201d registration plates are just released, so
        plenty of drivers are finding ways to afford a new set of wheels. </p><p>And
        there are a range of payment options, from buying outright to taking out finance.
        </p><p>But before taking the plunge, it''s important to make sure you understand
        exactly what''s involved before splashing out on what will probably be the
        most expensive thing you''ll buy after your home.\u00a0 </p><p>Here are five
        ways to afford your new car: </p><h2> 1. Using cash or savings </h2><p>The
        reality is few people can afford to buy a new car without needing to borrow
        money for some or all of the cost, although using savings is the cheapest
        way to finance a car purchase. </p><p>If you don\u2019t have enough savings
        to buy the car outright, you could use them to give you the biggest deposit
        possible. </p><p>Even if you use money from your savings, you may be better
        off buying the car on your credit card (although you should pay the bill off
        in full the next month) so you benefit from credit card purchase protection.
        </p><h2>2. Personal loan </h2><p>You can get a personal loan from a bank,
        building society or finance provider, and these are usually the cheapest way
        to finance a car (so long as your credit rating is good). </p><p>Make sure
        the loan is not secured against your home, otherwise you will be putting your
        home at risk if you failed to keep up with repayments. </p><p>Shop around
        for the best interest rate by comparing the APR (or annual percentage rate,
        which includes charges you have to pay as well as the interest). </p><h2>
        3. Hire purchase </h2><p>Hire purchase is a form of finance and is paid in
        installments spread over 12-60 months and you usually (but not always) have
        to put down a 10% deposit. </p><p>They are arranged by the car dealer and
        are often very competitive for new cars (less so for used cars). The loan
        is secured against the car, so you don\u2019t own it until the last payment
        is made. </p><h2>4. Personal Contract Plan </h2><p>This type of car finance
        deal is a variation on hire purchase and tends to result in lower monthly
        payments. </p><p>Instead of paying for the car outright, you agree to pay
        the difference between its sale price and its price for resale back to the
        dealer, based on a forecast of annual mileage over the term of the agreement.
        </p><p>Payments are spread over a shorter term of 12 to 36 months. </p><h2>5.
        Personal Leasing </h2><p>You can pay the dealer a fixed monthly amount for
        the use of a car, with servicing and maintenance included, as long as the
        mileage doesn\u2019t exceed a specified limit. </p><p>At the end of the agreement,
        you hand the car back. It never belongs to you.\u00a0 </p><h2>Car financing:
        Things to watch out for\u00a0\u00a0 </h2><p>As you compare car financing,
        <strong>there are a few key things to do</strong> before making a final choice.
        </p><ul><li>Make sure you can afford the monthly payment.</li><li>Make sure
        you compare interest rates by looking at the APR (annual percentage rate),
        which includes all the charges you have to pay. Remember that a higher deposit
        will normally mean a lower interest rate.</li><li>Compare the total cost of
        borrowing, including all charges over the loan.</li><li>Think carefully before
        buying payment protection insurance (PPI) or other insurance, which can be
        expensive and may give limited cover.</li><li>Beware of early repayment or
        other charges, which kick in if you exceed the forecast mileage in personal
        contract plans (and also personal leasing).</li></ul><p><a title=\"Guide to

        as we all like to have non-essentials, if you are saving for something or
        struggling to pay your bills, not changing your spending habits could push
        you into debt. </p><p>Here are our top tips to help you start managing your
        money </p><p><strong>Set up a budget </strong></p><p>If you want to get on
        top of your finances, a budget is a really good way to start. It\u2019s just
        a record of money you have coming in (from things like your salary or wages
        to pensions or benefits) and money going out (such as your rent or mortgage,
        insurance and Council Tax as well as living expenses and regular and irregular
        spending). </p><p>A great way to work out your budget is with our <a title=\"Budget
        planner\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.moneyadviceservice.org.uk/en/tools/budget-planner\">online
        budget planner</a>. </p><p><strong>Check where your money goes </strong></p><p>Keeping
        a spending diary is an effective way of seeing exactly what you spend your
        money on. Try making a note of what you spend for at least a month (including
        even small purchases). If you can do it for even longer, you\u2019ll get a
        fuller picture of what you spend your money on. </p><p>Then look through your
        diary to see where you can cut back. </p><p>Our <a title=\"Cutback calculator\"
        target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.moneyadviceservice.org.uk/en/tools/cut-back-calculator\">cut-back
        calculator</a> will quickly show you how small changes to your day-to-day
        spending can save you money in the long run. Even small amounts \u2013 for
        things such as magazines, sandwiches at lunchtime or takeaways \u2013 can
        add up. </p><p><strong>Set a savings goal </strong></p><p>Some people find
        it hard to get motivated about saving, but it\u2019s often much easier if
        you <a title=\"Set a savings goal\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.moneyadviceservice.org.uk/en/tools/how-to-set-a-savings-goal\">set
        a goal</a> perhaps to pay for a holiday or a deposit on a new home. That way,
        rather than thinking about the money you are setting aside each month, you
        can focus on what you will be able to do with it once you\u2019ve reached
        your target. </p><p>You might decide cutting back on one or two luxuries is
        easier when you know it can help you achieve your goal. </p><p>Photo: PA</p>","date":"2014-07-14T09:08:00+00:00"}]'
