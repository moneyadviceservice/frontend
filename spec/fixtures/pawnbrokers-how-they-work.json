Pawnbrokers lend money quickly without credit checks and charge higher rates of interest than high street banks. </p><h2>What are pawnbrokers?\u00a0 </h2><ul><li>You hand over the item (known as a pawn) to the pawnbroker who will value it for you.</li><li>The pawnbroker should give you a 'Pre-contract Information Document' detailing the terms of the credit agreement before the transaction takes place.</li><li>You\u2019ll sign a credit agreement with the pawnbroker\u00a0and be given a period of time in which to pay back the loan. The maximum is seven months, but it can be less, such as 30 \u2013 90 days, for example.</li><li>The pawnbroker gives you a pawn receipt which you\u2019ll need to keep to prove you own the item.</li><li>When you\u2019ve repaid the money owed you get the item back. But if you don\u2019t repay the loan after the agreed period the pawnbroker can sell it to recover the cash.</li><li>It is possible to extend the loan, once you have paid back the accrued interest.</li><li>There is a 14-day cooling off period, within which you have a right to withdraw from the agreement.</li></ul><p>If you want to use a pawnbroker choose one that is a member of the National Pawnbrokers\u2019 Association, which has a code of conduct for members. </p><p><div class=\"add-action\"><span class=\"action-text\"><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.thenpa.com/\">Visit the NPA\u2019s website</a></span> <a href=\"#\" class=\"action-email\" data-action-id=\"895\" data-article-id=\"\" data-article-type=\"\" id=\"email_me_895\" tabindex=\"0\">Email this <span class=\"visuallyhidden\">page</span></a><form action=\"/en/action_items/external?external_action_id=895\" class=\"action-form\" data-remote=\"true\" data-resource-path=\"/en/action_items/external?external_action_id=895\" method=\"post\" name=\"895\"><div><input class=\"action-submit\" data-action-event=\"add\" tabindex=\"0\" type=\"submit\" value=\"Add to my to do list\" /><input name=\"authenticity_token\" type=\"hidden\" value=\"kTi4/tnwj1NQ1oXyJyJpmN4j6BaP26R9NAic/NRPagY=\" /></div></form> </div></p><h2>How do pawnbrokers work? - What you\u2019ll pay, and how </h2><p>You can expect to pay a pawnbroker a rate of interest that is more than a high street bank loan, but often a lot less than a payday lender. </p><p>You\u2019ll be quoted a monthly interest rate, although the pawnbroker must also show you an APR or annual percentage rate.\u00a0Shop around to find the most competitive rate of interest, which can be anything from between 5-12% a month.\u00a0 </p><p>You are normally allowed to pay all you owe back at the end of the term, rather than in regular installments and you should be able to pay back part or all of your loan early. </p><p>If you need more time to repay, the pawnbroker can extend the term and draw up a new credit agreement, although they can refuse. They will normally only consider letting you borrow for a longer period of time if you have at the very least paid back the interest you owe. </p><h2>What you can pawn </h2><p>You can pawn anything of value that can be re-sold. Jewellery is the most popular item to pawn, but people have been known to pawn anything from designer handbags to army tanks. </p><h3>Pawnbrokers - The pros </h3><ul class=\"yes-no\"><li class=\"yes\">There are no credit checks so if you have a poor credit rating you can borrow.</li><li class=\"yes\">It\u2019s quick \u2013 normally you will have your money the same day you sign your agreement.</li><li class=\"yes\">A pawnbroker should let you redeem your goods at any time and only charge interest for the period you have borrowed the money.</li></ul><h3>Pawnbrokers - The cons </h3><ul class=\"yes-no\"><li class=\"no\">Using a pawnbroker is\u00a0a relatively expensive way to borrow. One online pawnbroker charges an APR of 84% for some loans.</li><li class=\"no\">You can usually only borrow a percentage of the value of the item you want to pawn. So if, for example, you have some jewellery worth \u00a3200, you might only be able to borrow \u00a3100.</li><li class=\"no\">If you do not repay your loan the pawnbroker will sell your item (after giving you notice).\u00a0If they can\u2019t sell it for enough money to pay off the loan in full you will have to repay the remaining debt. So you will lose the item and still owe the pawnbroker money.</li><li class=\"no\">The item you pawn can be sold for less than it\u2019s worth and less than you could have sold it for yourself.</li></ul><h2>What to do if you can\u2019t pay them back </h2><p>If you can\u2019t repay your loan by the deadline and you don\u2019t want your item to be sold you need to ask the pawnbroker to extend the deadline, but they are not obliged to let you do so. </p><p>If you borrowed less than \u00a375 and you cannot repay the loan, the item will belong to the pawnbroker. If you borrowed more than \u00a375, the pawnbroker can sell it but it still belongs to you.\u00a0 </p><p>If the loan is for over \u00a3100 the pawnbroker has to tell you in advance that they are going to sell it. This gives you a chance to pay them and get your goods back. </p><p>It doesn\u2019t happen very often, but if the sale raises more money than you owe, you will lose the item but the pawnbroker must give you any money left over, although you have to ask for it. </p><h2>What happens if you lose your receipt </h2><p>If you borrowed less than \u00a375 you can get a \u2018standard form\u2019 from the pawnbroker which you sign to say the property is yours. Remember the pawnbroker does not have to give you this. </p><p>If you borrowed more than \u00a375 or if the pawnbroker will not issue a standard form, then you need to legally swear that the goods are yours by going to a magistrate or a Commissioner for Oaths, or a Justice of the Peace if you live in Scotland. You can also go to a solicitor, but they are likely to charge a fee for this. Otherwise the pawnbroker does not have to give you your property back. </p><h2>What to do if you feel they have been unfair </h2><p>Make sure you know the value of the item before you pawn it, that way you have evidence if you feel the pawnbroker has sold it for less than it was worth. </p><p>First complain to the pawnbroker in writing, you can use evidence such as newspaper clippings or written quotes to back up your claim. </p><p>You can take a pawnbroker to the Small Claims Court but there are fees to pay and there is always a risk that the settlement reached may not be what you want. </p><h2>Alternatives to pawnbrokers </h2><p>Borrowing money via a pawnbroker is expensive and can cost you more than money. Make sure you consider other options. </p><p><div class=\"add-action\"><a href=\"/en/articles/budgeting-loans-from-the-social-fund\">Budgeting Loans from the Social Fund</a> <a href=\"#\" class=\"action-email\" data-action-id=\"\" data-article-id=\"budgeting-loans-from-the-social-fund\" data-article-type=\"guide\" id=\"email_me_budgeting-loans-from-the-social-fund\" tabindex=\"0\">Email this <span class=\"visuallyhidden\">page</span></a><form action=\"/en/action_items/internal?article_id=budgeting-loans-from-the-social-fund&amp;article_type=guide\" class=\"action-form\" data-remote=\"true\" data-resource-path=\"/en/action_items/internal?article_id=budgeting-loans-from-the-social-fund&amp;article_type=guide\" method=\"post\" name=\"guide_budgeting-loans-from-the-social-fund\"><div><input class=\"action-submit\" data-action-event=\"add\" tabindex=\"0\" type=\"submit\" value=\"Add to my to do list\" /><input name=\"authenticity_token\" type=\"hidden\" value=\"kTi4/tnwj1NQ1oXyJyJpmN4j6BaP26R9NAic/NRPagY=\" /></div></form> </div></p><p><div class=\"add-action\"><a href=\"/en/articles/credit-unions\">Borrowing from a Credit Union</a> <a href=\"#\" class=\"action-email\" data-action-id=\"\" data-article-id=\"credit-unions\" data-article-type=\"guide\" id=\"email_me_credit-unions\" tabindex=\"0\">Email this <span class=\"visuallyhidden\">page</span></a><form action=\"/en/action_items/internal?article_id=credit-unions&amp;article_type=guide\" class=\"action-form\" data-remote=\"true\" data-resource-path=\"/en/action_items/internal?article_id=credit-unions&amp;article_type=guide\" method=\"post\" name=\"guide_credit-unions\"><div><input class=\"action-submit\" data-action-event=\"add\" tabindex=\"0\" type=\"submit\" value=\"Add to my to do list\" /><input name=\"authenticity_token\" type=\"hidden\" value=\"kTi4/tnwj1NQ1oXyJyJpmN4j6BaP26R9NAic/NRPagY=\" /></div></form> </div></p>"}
