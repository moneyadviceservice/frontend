Feature: Money Navigator Journey
As a user of the Money Navigator tool
I want to be able to move through the process from the 
landing page to the results page without issues

Scenario: Choosing all default answers
#   Given I am on the Money Navigator tool landing page
#   When  I choose to start the process
#   And   I give default answers to all the questions
#   Then  I should see results on the Money Navigator tool results page
