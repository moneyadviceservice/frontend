        in late 2012 and further price increases are due this month (January 2013)

        \"Offers and incentives and some buyers shifting from buying used to new cars
        could have contributed to the upturn.\" </p><p>Some buyers believe older cars
        are starting to cost more to run, tax and insure as they often have bigger,
        more powerful engines. And as a result, new cars are becoming increasingly
        attractive purchases by offering long-term value for money. </p><p>UK new
        car registrations rose 5.3% in 2012 to 2.04 million - the highest level since
        2008. And although the 2013 market will be challenging, SMMT is predicting

        retirement incomes have fallen for the second consecutive year, according
        to findings in a new report from Prudential. </p><p>The sixth annual ''Class
        of'' study, which tracks the future plans and aspirations of people entering
        retirement, found that those retiring in 2013 expect average incomes of \u00a315,300
        per year - \u00a3200 less than the Class of 2012''s expectations. </p><p>According
        to the study, expected retirement incomes have fallen in four of the past
        five years, and are now \u00a33,400 lower than they were in 2008, when a typical
        person entering retirement anticipated an annual income of \u00a318,700. </p><p>The
        real-term fall in incomes, however, is even higher due to rises in living
        costs. According to Prudential, since 2008, inflation has caused prices to
        rise by 14.7 per cent. </p><p>Someone who retired last year would therefore
        need an annual income of \u00a321,400, to have the same buying power as an
        average person entering retirement in 2008. </p><p>Despite expected retirement
        incomes falling nationally overall, they actually increased in certain areas
        of the UK. The most significant year-on-year increases were in Yorkshire and
        Humberside, where they increased by \u00a3600 to \u00a313,400. </p><p>Notable
        increases also occurred in the South West, where an average 2013 retiree''s
        estimate was \u00a3500 more than that of their 2012 counterpart - \u00a315,600
        compared with \u00a315,100. Scotland, the North West and London also saw increases

        more than \u00a350,000 a year will no longer be able to claim the total amount

        for each of their other children. Payments apply to all children under 16
        and in some cases until they are 20 years old. </p><p>If either parent has
        income over \u00a350,000, they will have to pay a new tax that equals 1% of
        the family\u2019s Child Benefit for every extra \u00a3100 of income over \u00a350,000.
        </p><p>If either parent has income over \u00a360,000, the new tax will be

        caught by these rules, they can either: </p><ul><li>keep claiming it, but
        must then fill out a self-assessment tax form, so HM Revenue &amp; Customs

        can instead opt not to receive Child Benefit, but they should still go through
        the Child Benefit claims procedure, so they still get the credits towards

        19 December 2012\u00a0</strong></p><p class=\"intro\">The Money Advice Service
        has begun a 12 week consultation on quality standards within the debt advice
        sector in the UK. </p><p>We took on responsibility for the co-ordination of
        the sector earlier in 2012, with a remit to improve the accessibility, quality
        and consistency of debt advice. </p><p>The quality of debt advice is recognised
        to vary across the country and the new consultation invites views on a framework
        which will set a benchmark for debt advice delivery and bring about greater
        consistency. </p><p>The framework has been informed by an independent review
        carried out by the Money Advice Trust, which found that there is great diversity
        in the way debt advice is delivered, monitored and accredited. </p><p>It will
        apply to organisations and individuals working in the sector and is designed
        to build upon the good practice which already exists. </p><p>We are proposing
        that three principles for organisations sit at the heart of the framework:
        being receptive to client needs, demonstrating strong governance and promoting
        reflective and on-going learning. </p><p>The framework proposes greater clarity
        around the role profiles of debt advisers and sets out a minimum range of
        skills, knowledge and competencies for individuals working in the sector.
        </p><p>Following the consultation, the Money Advice Service will finalise
        details of the framework. It will then work with those operating in the sector,
        including organisations not currently funded by the Service, to ensure that
        the standards they follow meet the new benchmark. </p><p>By April 2014, organisations
        which receive funding from the Money Advice Service will need to demonstrate
        that the standards they follow are in line with the framework. </p><p><a href=\"/en/static/money-advice-service-consults-on-improving-the-quality-of-debt-advice-in-the-uk\">Read
