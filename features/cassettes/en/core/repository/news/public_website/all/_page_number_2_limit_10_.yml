        shows almost one in five motorists who bought a used car in the last two years
        blew their budget, spending \u00a31,815 more than they intended to. More than

        for a car</a> for top tips on affording the car you want. </p><h2>Saving to
        buy a car </h2><p>A car may be one of the most expensive things we buy, which
        is why most drivers rely on savings to pay for them. Friends and family stumped
        up some or all of the money in 13% of cases (many of whom will have to pay
        back what they are given), while 10% opted for a car finance deal. One in
        seven either used a personal loan or paid for their car on a credit card.
        </p><p>If you are thinking of using finance to buy a car, read our guide <a
        title=\"Whats the best way to finance a car?\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.moneyadviceservice.org.uk/en/articles/whats-the-best-way-to-finance-buying-a-car\">What''s
        the best way to finance a car?</a></p><h2>Running costs stall personal finances
        for many motorists </h2><p>It\u2019s not just buying the car that\u2019s likely
        to end up burning a hole in your pocket. Maintenance and repairs account for
        the largest unexpected cost, with a quarter of motorists spending \u00a3421
        on average more than they expected in the first 12 months. </p><p>Fuel costs
        have been high for some time, but they still caught out more than one in four
        drivers, who spent \u00a3295 on average more than they estimated. </p><p>Unexpectedly
        large insurance premiums were a headache for 23%, with the average policy
        costing \u00a3293 more than expected. It\u2019s of little surprise that two
        in ten car owners ended up in debt as a result of their purchase. </p><h2>Depreciation
        gets forgotten </h2><p>While the vast majority of recent second-hand car buyers
        took into account the purchase cost of buying a car, as well as fuel, insurance,
        possible repairs and maintenance as well as vehicle tax, more than one in
        four gave no thought to the MOT or depreciation. </p><p>All cars older than
        three years must have an annual MOT test - apart from the cost of the test
        you may have to pay to replace worn out parts or other repairs. </p><p>All
        cars will suffer from depreciation becoming worth less to reflect wear and
        tear as well as other factors, but some makes and models hold their value
        better than others. </p><p>It is an important issue for drivers who intend
        to sell their car after a few years, and hope to recoup a decent amount of
        their initial spend. </p><p>Our <a title=\"Car costs calculator\" target=\"_blank\"
        href=\"https://www.moneyadviceservice.org.uk/en/tools/car-costs-calculator\">Car
        costs calculator</a> allows you to see the effects of depreciation on the
        value of a car, as well as typical amounts you\u2019d expect to pay for the
        vehicle, maintenance and insurance. </p><h2>More than one in four struggled
        to cover car-running costs </h2><p>While many drivers can cope with higher-than-expected
        motor-related bills, 27% said they found it hard to meet the costs of keeping
        their car on the road. Parents with children living at home and female drivers
        in particular struggled to meet the essentials. </p><p>Three in five of those
        who experienced difficulties in keeping their car on the road said they were
        forced to cut back on other things, such as treats and clothing, to pay their
        bills. Almost one in four of these motorists felt it had a big impact on household
        finance, but more worrying is that one in five got into debt or increased
        their debt in order to pay for car-running costs. </p><h2>Haggling? </h2><p>If
        you want to save cash on a car purchase, consider haggling. Our guide gives

        not seem like a very British thing to do. But it seems when it comes to buying
        a second-hand car most of us aren\u2019t afraid to try to beat down a price
        to get the best deal. </p><p>New research by the Money Advice Service into
        buying a used car shows eight out of 10 of people who bought a car in the
        past year tried to negotiate a discount when buying. </p><p>And more than
        six in 10 people got some money off the price - men fared slightly better

        new to the art of haggling, don\u2019t be daunted. Use our advice to get the
        best price for your next car. </p><h2>Know your Saab from your Seat </h2><p>If
        you don\u2019t know which car you are after do your research. Start looking
        at cars on the road, at your local car dealers, and in car magazines and motoring
        websites. </p><p>Even if you are after a particular model, set yourself a
        budget for what you can afford to pay. Don''t forget to look at running costs.

        tool. </p><p>If you\u2019re part-exchanging your current car, make sure you
        know what it\u2019s worth so you get the best price for it to put towards
        your new purchase. You''ll probably get more for it if you sell it privately
        but it can take you more time and effort. </p><p>Before you do anything, find
        out the value of your car. Sites such as <a title=\"Glasss\" target=\"_blank\"

        day of the quarter is even better. I''ve walked out of a showroom at 3pm only
        to be phoned back by the dealer at 5pm with the deal that I want as they have
        bonuses to make. Know how the industry works and get a deal.\"</em></p><h2>Seal
        the deal with a garage </h2><p>If you are negotiating with a dealer, be friendly
        and polite, but never let the salesperson know your maximum limit. </p><p>If
        you\u2019re a cash buyer, don\u2019t tell the salesperson this straight away.
        </p><p>Dealers make bigger profits on finance deals, so let them negotiate
        the car\u2019s price on that basis. You can then decline the finance deal
        later in the process. </p><p>Start off by stating an amount lower than you\u2019re
        actually prepared to pay \u2013 you can then gradually increase it if necessary.
        Try to avoid raising your price by far more than the dealer is dropping his
        price. </p><p>When you make an offer, don\u2019t speak again until the salesperson
        replies. </p><p>It also pays to be positive about your aims: for example,
        don\u2019t say <em>\u201ccan I have a discount?\u201d</em>, but instead say
        <em>\u201chow much discount can I have?\u201d</em></p><p>If you are struggling
        to get a discount but really want the car, offer to buy the car there and
        then. A quick sale may help you agree a price. </p><p>And don\u2019t be afraid
        to walk out if the dealer won\u2019t negotiate \u2013 there are plenty more
        fish in the sea when it comes to used cars. </p><p>For more haggling tips,

        a used car privately can be risky because if there are problems afterwards
        you have less legal comeback than you have with a dealer. </p><p>But you have
        more bargaining tools at your disposal. </p><p>The seller may have already
        bought their next car and need to offload their old one. So it might be worth
        asking some gentle questions about why they are selling. Or, they may have
        seen the perfect car for them and need to free up some cash. </p><p>When buying
        a used car you\u2019ll need to decide whether you want to take the chance
        of unexpected repair bills, although you can always pay an expert to inspect
        the car before buying. Companies such as the AA and RAC offer this type of
        service. Any faults or even chips and dents on the bodywork could be used

        a car</a>. </p><h2>1) Have a realistic budget </h2><p>Before you do anything
        else, you must work out how much you have to spend on a car. Don\u2019t let
        your heart rule your head. </p><p>Look beyond the basic purchase price, an
        d monthly finance repayments if you''re planning to borrow, and consider running
        costs. Fuel, road tax, maintenance, breakdown cover and insurance all add
        up to give you a total cost which can be as much as \u00a33,500 a year. </p><p><a

        calculator</a> to discover how much you could start saving towards your new
        car. </p><h2>2) Choose the right car for you </h2><p>Once you''ve worked out
        your budget, it''s time to see what you can get for your money. Here there
        are more decisions to make, such as whether you''re going to buy new or used,
        and will it be petrol, diesel, hybrid or electric? </p><p>Do your research
        and find out about reliability, safety and values. Get recommendations from
        friends and family and look at car websites such as <a title=\"WhatCar?\"
        target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.whatcar.com/\">WhatCar?</a> and <a title=\"Which?
        Car\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.which.co.uk/cars/\">Which?</a> for
        advice on which cars to buy. </p><p>Also consider depreciation (the difference
        between a car\u2019s value when you buy it and when you come to sell it) and
        a car''s tax band. Broadly speaking, the lower the band the less you pay in
        road tax , insurance and fuel. </p><p>Use our <a title=\"Car costs calculator\"

        all you need is the registration number of the car you\u2019re thinking of
        buying. </p><h2>3) Buy at the right time </h2><p>Getting a good deal on a
        used car can also depend on the time of year you buy it. Make sure you take
        advantage of seasonal factors that affect the car trade. </p><p>For instance,
        March and September are the peak months for sales of new cars, often through
        part-exchange deals. So dealers will have lots of used cars to sell, which
        puts you in a strong position when negotiating. </p><p><a title=\"When to

        tips on when to buy a car</a></p><h2>4) Check it out </h2><p>Carry out checks
        before handing over your hard-earned cash on a used car. </p><p>Many cars
        have hidden histories so start by carrying out a history check to discover
        who owns the car or whether it''s the subject of an outstanding finance agreement.
        It will also tell you whether it''s been an insurance write-off or has any
        or mileage inconsistencies. </p><p>The following are some of the organisations

        vehicle inspector to check the car as well. The AA, the RAC and a number of
        other companies provide such services. </p><h2>5) Negotiate the price </h2><p>For
        many, the hardest part of the car-buying process is negotiating, or haggling,
        with the seller. Whether it''s a dealer or private seller, you''re going to
        have to shake on a deal. Read our <a title=\"How to negotiate when buying

        tips for negotiating the price of a used car</a>. </p><p>But before discussing
        the price, make sure you know your budget, you''ve researched the value of
        the car by looking at similar ones for sale on websites and in classified
        ads, or by looking at car valuation guides in magazines and websites such
        as WhatCar? and Auto Trader. </p>","date":"2014-07-09T16:42:18+00:00"},{"id":"buying-a-used-car-when-to-walk-away","title":"Buying

        is a common ruse used by criminals selling stolen or cloned vehicles. If you\u2019re
        buying privately, you should always view the car at the registered keeper\u2019s
        address, as detailed on the V5 (log book). </p><p>Never buy a car in a service
        station or pub car park. To find out how to test drive and check a used car

        to test drive and check a used car</a>. </p><h2>Documents check </h2><p>At
        the very least, a used car should come with a V5 document (log book) and a
        valid MOT. Also check that the V5C has a watermark and there are no spelling
        mistakes or alterations. </p><p>The name and address on the V5C should match
        the seller''s (if in doubt, ask to see the seller''s driving licence) and
        check the the VIN (chassis number) on the V5C matches the VIN number on the
        car. </p><p>The VIN number can be found in various places, but it is often
        embossed on a metal plate in the engine bay or on the body of the car - sometimes
        around a door. Be suspicious if the plate looks damaged or has been tampered
        with. </p><p>The VIN should also be engraved at the base of the windscreen
        on the passenger\u2019s side. The car also must have an MOT to demonstrate
        that it''s roadworthy. A sign of a good used car is when it comes with previous
        MOT documents. It\u2019s even better if I has a service history too. </p><h2>Genuine
        mileage? </h2><p>If the car has no service history or previous MOTs it''s
        difficult to check its mileage there and then. However, there are still a
        few signs to look out for. </p><p>For instance, the mileage is low, but the
        wear and tear looks heavy or maybe the steering wheel and gear knob look newer
        than the rest of the car, suggesting they have been changed for the sale.
        Also, if the milometer is analogue (not digital), check to see if the numbers
        are out of line. </p><p>Back home, if you have the V5C registration certificate,
        number plate and MOT test number, you can check free via the <a title=\"Check

        and Vehicle Standards Agency</a> (DVSA). </p><h2>The price is right </h2><p>If
        you''ve done your research and the asking price is so low it''s too good to
        be true, then it probably is. The car may well have a hidden history, be stolen
        or it does not belong to the person selling it. </p><p>Use our <a title=\"car

        </p><h2>Independent inspection </h2><p>Various motoring organisations, such
        as the RAC and Green Flag, carry out vehicle inspections for a fee to give
        you a little extra peace of mind. If the seller refuses to allow an independent
        inspection, then they''ve probably got something to hide. </p>","date":"2014-07-09T15:53:28+00:00"},{"id":"keep-on-running-six-ways-to-save-on-car-maintenance","title":"Keep
        on running \u2013 six ways to save on car maintenance","description":"Paying
        to maintain your car can be expensive. Find out how to cut down your maintenance
        bills.","body":"<p class=\"intro\"> One of the best ways to cut down on the
        cost of running a car is to make sure that it needs as little repair work
        as possible. </p><p>However, one in three motorists lack the basic knowledge
        to keep their car maintained, despite nearly 59% feeling such maintenance
        is essential, according to a survey for Auto Trader. </p><p>With care and
        attention, shopping around and planning, it''s possible to cut your costs.
        A 2013 survey by Trust My Garage, the national independent garage scheme,
        found that 64% of car owners have had to find up to \u00a3500 for unexpected
        car repair bills. Over a fifth had to pay more than \u00a3500, whilst 10%
        of motorists had to shell out more than \u00a31,000. </p><h2>1) Save money
        on servicing </h2><p>Big savings can be made on your car''s annual service
        by going to a local independent garage instead of main dealers. According
        to the Independent Garage Association, a visit to an independent garage costs
        \u00a340 an hour less on average than a franchise dealer. </p><p>If you''re
        trying a garage for the first time, get a quote, ask for a list with prices
        and compare prices locally. </p><p>Also consider chains such as Halfords Autocentre
        which offers full services from \u00a3134 and claims to be up to 40% less
        than main dealers when booked online. </p><p>You can find recommended garages

        My Garage</a></p><h2>2) Don''t forget basic checks </h2><ul><li>Check the
        tyres regularly. Running them at the right pressure not only saves fuel, but
        makes them last longer. Tyres that are over or under pressure wear unevenly
        and will need to be replaced sooner. Check the tracking regularly too as wheels
        that are out of alignment wear unevenly.</li><li>Consider ordering your tyres
        online. Some companies will fit them at your home, others have a network of
        trusted fitters.</li><li>Avoid possible nasty repair bills by keeping your
        oil, coolant and brake fluid levels topped up.</li><li>According to the AA,
        flat batteries are their most common call-out, many failing after only a few
        years because they are not fully charged. Modern batteries need the odd long
        journey to fully charge. The AA estimates 240 miles of driving with no load
        or eight hours of continuous driving. Alternatively, using a battery trickle
        charger occasionally might extend your car battery''s life.</li></ul><h2>3)
        Get a cut-price MOT </h2><p>Companies can only charge up to the official maximum
        of \u00a354.85 for an MOT but a quick search online will turn up many garages
        which will test your car for as much as half the price. You may also be able
        to get a discount using online vouchers and getting your MOT done at the same
        time as a service. </p><p>You can also get an MOT done at a local council
        test centre. They don\u2019t normally carry out repairs as well as MOTs which
        means they are impartial when inspecting your car. </p><p>For a list of local

        garages and ask them for an itemised list of parts and labour. You are now
        equipped with all the information you need to go to online or visit your local
        auto recycling company to see if you can source the parts cheaper yourself.
        However, before buying anything, make sure the garage you have chosen will
        fit your parts. </p><h2>5) Learn how to do it yourself </h2><p>Ask friends
        and family or go on a basic car maintenance course so that you''re able to
        carry out ongoing checks and maybe even the odd repair yourself. With labour
        costs in garages upwards of \u00a340 per hour, learning how to change windscreen
        wipers, bulbs or even brake pads could save you hundreds of pounds. </p><h2>6)

        our complete guide to buying and selling a car</a></p><h2>Car ownership </h2><p>Hundreds
        of cars are stolen in the UK every day, a large number of which are sold on
        to unsuspecting buyers. A car history check will tell you if the vehicle has
        been stolen. </p><p>It will also reveal whether the car has been ''cloned''
        which is when criminals disguise the identity of a stolen vehicle with that
        of a legitimate one using fake documents. </p><h2>Outstanding finance </h2><p>One
        in four vehicles checked by vehicle information company HPI is still subject
        to an outstanding finance agreement. A check will determine whether the car
        is still on a finance deal and therefore still owned by a finance company.
        </p><p>Remember, the registered keeper of the vehicle (the name on the V5
        registration certificate) is not necessarily the owner of the vehicle or the
        person who is paying for it. Anyone trying to sell a car that has finance
        outstanding is breaking the law - even if they had no knowledge of the agreement,
        as they are not the legal owner of the vehicle. </p><h2>Insurance write-off
        </h2><p>According to vehicle information service, AutoCheck, 13% of used cars
        have previously been written off. When a vehicle is written off it is placed
        into an industry recognised damage classification, depending on its condition.
        </p><p>Category A or B write-offs are vehicles that should be crushed and
        never returned to the road for safety reasons. Category C and D vehicles can
        go back on the road, but buyers must be sure that they are roadworthy before
        they drive them. A car history check will tell you whether a car has been
        written off and which category it\u2019s been given. </p><h2>Suspect mileage
        </h2><p>''Clocking'' a vehicle to alter its mileage can add thousands of pounds
        to the value of a car. A car history check should also produce mileage data.
        If the seller has old MOT certificates, you can also check the mileage section
        of them. If you''re still suspicious, you can even contact previous owners
        named on the V5 registration certificate. </p><p>You can also <a title=\"Discover

        drivers - six ways to cut insurance","description":"Car insurance is expensive
        enough for experienced motorists, but it''s often prohibitive for young drivers.
        Read our tips for getting the best deals","body":"<p class=\"intro\">The cost
        of car insurance is expensive enough for experienced motorists, but it''s
        often prohibitive for young drivers aged 17-25. </p><p> There are almost three
        million drivers under 25 on UK roads paying an average of nearly \u00a32,000
        in insurance each year, according to the Association of British Insurers (ABI).
        Costs are set to rise as experts predict car insurance premiums will go up
        by as much as 15% in 2014/15. </p><p>Read our top tips for getting the best
        young person\u2019s insurance deal\u2026 </p><h2>1) Choose a car in a low
        insurance group </h2><p>Cars are divided into 50 insurance groups according
        to various factors including their engine size and the likely cost of repairs.
        The higher the insurance group, the higher the premium. So if you are a young
        driver, it pays to check a car''s insurance rating before committing to buy
        it. </p><p>Generally speaking, insurance groups 1-2 are packed with small
        city cars such as the Hyundai i10, Skoda Citigo, Nissan Pixo, Vauxhall Corsa,
        Dacia Sandero and Volkwagen Up! </p><p>Insurance group 3 cars includes more
        common everyday cars such as the Ford Fiesta, Citroen C1, Toyota Aygo, Vauxhall
        Adam and Skoda Fabia. </p><p>The same applies for used cars, which are more
        likely targets for young drivers. Popular used car buys include the Vauxhall
        Corsa, Citroen Saxo, Ford Ka and Reanult Clio. </p><h2>2) Pick a suitable
        level of cover </h2><p>Although by law you must have car insurance, there
        are three different levels of cover: </p><ul><li>third party</li><li>third
        party, fire and theft</li><li>comprehensive</li></ul><p>Broadly speaking,
        if you''d struggle to replace your car if it was written off in an accident,
        it''s best to go for fully comprehensive insurance, but if you''re driving
        a car that''s worth \u00a31,000 or less, third party insurance might be a
        good option. However, fully comprehensive cover can cost less than third party,
        so it''s always worth comparing prices. </p><p>Third party is the minimum
        cover you can legally have and it covers other people (third parties), but
        not you. If you injure someone or damage their property, they\u2019re covered
        but if your own car is damaged or stolen, you have to pay for the loss yourself.
        </p><p>Third party, fire and theft cover is similar to third party in that
        it covers other people so if your own car is damaged, you have to pay for
        it yourself. The difference is that it does cover repairs or replacement if
        your car is stolen or damaged by fire. </p><p>Fully comprehensive is the highest
        level of cover - it\u2019s the only type that covers you if you damage your
        own car, even if the accident was your fault. </p><h2>3) Drive carefully and
        safely </h2><p>Prove you are low-risk by driving safely and having no accidents,
        not making claims and not incurring any penalty points on your licence in
        your first years of driving. </p><p>These will all have an impact on your
        premium when you come to renew your insurance. </p><p>However, careful young
        drivers still end up getting penalised for the accidents and bad driving of
        some of their peers. </p><p>This is where black box or telematics insurance
        schemes are worth considering. Aimed at drivers under 25, the schemes involve
        fitting a \"black box\" to a car which records how you drive. It can save
        young drivers as much as \u00a3800 a year on premiums. </p><p>The black box
        records builds up a picture of a driver''s behaviour at the wheel, recording
        the time of day, mileage, acceleration, braking and cornering. </p><h2>4)
        Build up your No -Claims Bonus </h2><p>It''s worth remembering that every
        claim-free year that passes, you build up a year\u2019s no-claims bonus (NCB)
        which gives you a discount on your following year''s premium. </p><p>Once
        you''ve built up five claim-free years\u2019 driving, the discount could be
        worth as much as 70% off the cost of your cover. </p><p>There may also be
        another way to build up your no-claims bonus in less time. Some insurers offer
        a \"bonus accelerator\" policy. It runs for 10 months and providing you have
        been claim free, you will earn a full year''s no claims bonus. In theory,
        you could build up three years'' NCB in 2.5 years. However, not all insurers
        accept an accelerated NCB so you should check if you''re planning to switch
        company. </p><p>Finally, consider adding an older named driver, such as a
        parent, to bring down the cost. However, this person can\u2019t pretend to
        be the main driver \u2013 this is called ''fronting'' and is illegal. </p><h2>5)
        Get extra driving qualifications </h2><p>You could earn a reduction on your
        car premium by improving your driving skills. However, before signing up for
        any advanced driving course, it''s best to check with your insurer to make
        sure a discount is available. </p><p>The Driver and Vehicle Standards Agency
        (DVSA) Pass Plus course is a practical training course that takes at l east
        six hours and is aimed at newly qualified drivers and covers driving on all
        types of road, all weathers and at night. You can find more information at
        <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.gov.uk/pass-plus/overview\">gov.uk/pass-plus/overview</a></p><p>The
        Institute of Advanced Motorists and RoSPA also offer advanced driving skills
        courses. </p><h3>6) Shop around for the best deal </h3><p>Use a comparison
        site or get on the phone to compare quotes from different insurers. The more
        time you put in, the more likely you are to get better cover and a cheaper
        price. </p><p>Finally, <a title=\"Find a broker\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.biba.org.uk/ConsumerHome.aspx\">find
        a broker on the British Insurers Brokers'' Association (BIBA) website</a>

        used car buying myths","description":"More than five million of us do it every
        year, yet buying a used car can be a minefield. Here are five used car buying
        myths to watch out for","body":"<p class=\"intro\"> More than five million
        of us do it every year, yet buying a used car can be a minefield. </p><p>Getting
        good advice from friends and family is important, but they may not always
        be right - common misconceptions can lead to costly mistakes. Here are five
        used car buying myths to watch out for... </p><h2>Myth 1 </h2><p><strong>The
        car is mine once I''ve paid for it and the paperwork has been exchanged.</strong></p><p>Not
        quite. A registration document (V5), or logbook, is not proof of ownership.
        The V5 only shows the registered keeper of the vehicle - not necessarily the
        owner of the vehicle or the person who is paying for it. </p><p>For instance,
        if you are buying your car on a finance deal such as PCP (Personal Contract
        Purchase) or HP, the car belongs to the finance company until you have made
        the final payment. </p><p>Before buying a used car, <a title=\"How to test
        drive and check a used car\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.moneyadviceservice.org.uk/en/articles/how-to-test-drive-and-check-a-used-car\">consider
        having an HPI check</a> to determine who owns the car. </p><h2>Myth 2 </h2><p><strong>It\u2019s
        illegal to sell a car that\u2019s been a write-off - it must be scrapped and
        never driven again.</strong></p><p>Wrong. Any vehicle that has been declared
        a total loss (often referred to as \u201ca write-off\u201d) by an insurance
        company will be because the insurer believes it\u2019s uneconomical to repair.
        </p><p>When the vehicle is written off, it is given a damage classification,
        depending on its condition. A or B category write-offs are vehicles that should
        be crushed and never returned to the road for safety reasons. Category C and
        D vehicles can be repaired, but buyers must be sure that they are roadworthy.
        An HPI check will show which category it\u2019s been given. </p><h2>Myth 3
        </h2><p><strong>Buying at a \u2018mutually convenient\u2019 public location
        is safe.</strong></p><p>Wrong. Sometimes a seller will suggest meeting halfway,
        at a motorway service station for instance, so you can view the car. It may
        seem like a kind gesture, but beware, this is a common ruse used by criminals
        selling stolen or cloned vehicles. </p><p>If you\u2019re buying privately,
        you should always view the car at the registered keeper\u2019s address, as
        detailed on the V5. Never buy a car in a service station or pub car park.
        </p><h2>Myth 4 </h2><p><strong>New cars are cheaper than used cars to run.</strong></p><p>Yes,
        at first glance, because new cars are generally more fuel efficient than used
        cars. </p><p>However, fuel is not necessarily the biggest cost. A new car
        loses as much as 50% of its value in the first three years of its life. And
        while used cars depreciate too, it''s not at such a dramatic rate. </p><p>Consider
        the total cost of motoring, rather than just the original purchase price or
        ongoing car finance. Factor in depreciation, fuel economy, servicing, MOT
        tests, maintenance, insurance, road tax and breakdown cover. </p><div class=\"callout\"><p>Find

        versus a used car. The results can be surprising. If you''re buying outright,
        it can be cheaper to run a used car than a new car. </p><p>Based on the first
        three years of ownership, comparing a new and used Mini Clubman 1.6 Cooper
        Diesel Estate showed that a used 2011 version will cost more than \u00a31,000
        a year less to run. </p><div class=\"callout\"><p><a title=\"What Car? car

        Car?</a> also has a tool which only looks at depreciation. </p></div><p>The
        new Mini may have a three-year warranty, but depreciation is much higher -
        \u00a33,500 compared with \u00a31,791. </p><p>Assuming the new and used Minis
        were bought outright, the estimated total cost of motoring for the first year
        is \u00a35,375 for the new car and \u00a34,221 for the used car. Over three
        years, the new Mini will cost a total of \u00a314,434 compared with \u00a311,160
        for the used Mini. </p><h2>Myth 5 </h2><p><strong>Buying a used car from a
        dealer is more expensive than buying privately, but I''m getting a warranty
        so I''m covered if anything goes wrong.</strong></p><p>Not necessarily. A
        warranty from a dealer may give you peace of mind initially, but warranties
        sold for used cars often have so many conditions that it\u2019s difficult
        to work out exactly what they include. This could lead to a nasty surprise
        if you need to make a claim. </p><p>A report by Which? magazine in March 2014
        said: \"Pricey premiums and endless exclusions mean we can''t recommend any
        used-car warranties.\" </p><p>However, you have more legal protection when
        buying from a dealer where you are covered by the Sale of Goods Act 1979.
        It states that the car must be \u201cof a satisfactory quality\u201d, \u201cfit
        for purpose\u201d and \u201cas described\u201d. </p><p> If the car you bought
        fails on any of these points, you\u2018re entitled to have it repaired or
        replaced, or to get a partial or full refund. </p>","date":"2014-07-09T15:43:51+00:00"},{"id":"going-further-costs-more","title":"Going

        month on average, with three quarters of this sum devoted to rent, food and
        bills. With such high expenditure, it makes sense to look for ways to keep
        in control of your outgoings. Rent in particular is an important expense to
        manage. This is because you are signing a contract, which may have legal implications
        if you fail to pay all the rent you\u2019ve committed to. </p><h2>Student
        bank accounts </h2><p>Aside from finding somewhere to live and figuring out
        what course modules to study, fresher\u2019s week provides the opportunity
        to think about where to put your student loan and any grant or bursary you\u2019re
        entitled to. In many cases, this will mean opening a new bank account, There
        are lots out there, but what do you really need from one? </p><p>In truth
        it\u2019s fairly simple \u2013 you want an account that will give you access
        to your cash as you require and has an interest-free overdraft facility. Remember
        that you have the right to switch your account to another bank \u2013 without
        having to return any freebies \u2013 but you will have to clear any overdraft

        </h2><p>With your rent and bills in order, the next step is to set up a weekly
        budget. You should aim to cover all your food, travel and leisure costs, and
        to have a small sum left over to pay for unexpected purchases, clothes, and
        treats, such as festival tickets or a holiday. After paying your rent and
        other essential bills, then transfer your weekly budget from your savings
        account into your current account so that it\u2019s easier to keep track of
        your discretionary spending. </p><p>You could use a <a title=\"student calculator\"
        href=\"http://studentcalculator.org/\"><strong>student calculator</strong></a>\u00a0(if
        you are studying in England), and speak to a student money adviser in your
        university or college for more help with budgeting. </p><h2>Be thrifty and
        shop around </h2><p>You are bound to need books and other study aids, but
        why pay through the nose for them? It\u2019s worth riffling through second-hand
        and charity shops, as previous generations of students may have sold or gifted
        no-longer-wanted books and materials. Keep a look out for sales notices on
        student blogs and your university website too. </p><p>You have to eat, so
        work out where the cheapest supermarkets and market stalls are for different
        purchases. Independent greengrocers and butchers can also deliver quality,
        low-cost food, so don\u2019t forget to visit them. </p><p>Shopping around
        may seem a chore, but even if you just end up spending a few pounds less every
        week on like-for-like goods, your savings will soon mount up. </p><h2>Five
        top tips for savvy students </h2><p>The quicker you get to grips with your
        finances, the better. Here are five things to consider building into your
        student routine: </p><p><strong>1. Avoid eating out</strong> \u2013 It may
        be tempting to pop into your local caf\u00e9 each day for lunch, but you\u2019ll
        pay a hefty sum for the privilege. Try to get in the habit of taking a packed
        lunch: it\u2019s cheaper and you can avoid the seemingly endless food queues.
        </p><br/><p><strong>2. Buy in bulk</strong> \u2013 Where possible look for
        multi-buy deals, perhaps <a title=\"flatmates\" href=\"https://www.moneyadviceservice.org.uk/en/articles/budgeting-and-sharing-costs-when-renting\">splitting
        the cost with housemates</a>, and consider bulking out your meals with cheap,
        nutritional items such as lentils and black-eyed beans. Don\u2019t forget
        to invest in some herbs and spices, which will help make otherwise bland dishes
        tastier. </p><br/><p><strong>3. Use discounts</strong> \u2013 Check which
        shops will give you a discount if you have an NUS card, and make use of online
        discount voucher websites to get money off a range of goods and services.
        </p><br/><p><strong>4. Get protected</strong> \u2013 The chances are your
        room will be filled with expensive kit, from a computer and TV to clothes.
        Insuring them is important. However, home contents insurance for a student
        house isn\u2019t always straightforward. This can be because policies cover
        the house, not the person, making it problematic if you are sharing a property.
        Ask your parents to check their cover - if they have home insurance, it may
        cover you under the ''temporarily removed from the home'' section while you''re
        a student. </p><br/><p><strong>5. Beware of too much deb</strong><strong>t</strong>
        \u2013 It\u2019s very easy to overspend at university or college, but living
        within your means is a must. Unauthorised overdrafts can be very expensive,
        and student credit cards if applied for should only be used for emergencies.
        Likewise, avoid faceless credit like payday loans, as you could end up paying
        interest at a rate of more than 4,000%. If you are running out of money, speak
        to your bank to see if they can extend your overdraft, also review your budget
        and look for further ways to cut your spending. Finally, consider getting
        a job. Your student union may be able to help you find one, but also check
        local newspapers and ask friends for tips on which employers to approach.
