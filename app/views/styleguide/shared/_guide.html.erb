<h2>Help to Buy Scheme - Options (h2)</h2>

<p>Help to Buy - the two main schemes:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Equity loans</strong> - the government lends you up to a fifth of the value of a new-build home in
    England. A similar equity loan scheme is available in Scotland, for properties valued up to £400,000.
  </li>
  <li><strong>Mortgage guarantees</strong> - the government agrees to cover part of your mortgage if you only have a
    small deposit, taking on the default risk should you fall behind with payments.&nbsp;</li>
</ul>

  <h3>Budgeting tips</h3>

  <p>In 1985, average first-time buyers needed a deposit of 5% to buy a home - in 2012, this had increased to 20%

<p>Help to Buy is expected to help make up for the lack of higher loan-to-value products available.</p>

<p>While it’s still occasionally possible for people with a deposit of only 5% to get on the property ladder, the
  government felt there should be more competition between mortgage lenders to provide greater choice to home
  buyers.</p>

  <li>Borrowers will need to pass affordability checks with mortgage lenders. This varies by lender, but usually
    involves them checking that you’ll still be able to meet payments should interest rates go up.
  </li>
  <li>Borrowers will need to state that they have no interest in any other property worldwide, or won’t have by the
    time
    they complete on a mortgage guarantee scheme mortgage product.
