        protect your holiday budget \u2013 top tips","description":"Despite the much
        hyped trend of staycations, British travellers are increasingly opting for
        holidays abroad.","body":"<p><strong>Date published: 3 May 2013\u00a0</strong></p><p
        class=\"intro\">A new report from Tesco Travel Money has found that almost
        one in two Britons are planning to travel abroad as much as or even more frequently
        than they did five years ago. </p><p>The study also found that two out of
        five 18-24 year old holidaymakers plan to take a break in the next three months
        \u2013 higher than the national average of one in three adults. </p><p>Despite
        many households tightening their belts, the average annual outlay on getaways
        stands at \u00a31,527 per person, with the figure reaching \u00a31,718 for
        55-64 year-old travellers. The age group spending the least was found to be
        18-24 year olds, at \u00a31,062. </p><p>After what\u2019s been dubbed the
        UK\u2019s coldest winter in years, it\u2019s unsurprising that beach holidays
        remain the top choice of holiday, with two in five saying this is their favourite
        kind of trip. </p><p>Also popular are European city breaks, the preferred
        getaway for one in ten of those surveyed. </p><p>Travellers planning breaks
        away this spring however, will have to spend another \u00a390 to get the same
        amount of Euros they had last year, for an exchange of \u00a31000. </p><p>That\u2019s
        because the Pound is worth around 9% less against the Euro than this time
        last year. </p><p>With the countdown to the May half term beginning, we have
        some top tips to help holiday budgets go further this year. </p><ul><li><strong>Plan
        ahead and shop around</strong></li></ul><br/><p>Shop around for the best exchange
        rate deals to make the most of the weak Pound. Order cash in advance online
        or on the high street to avoid the less competitive rates offered at airports.
        Look out for free postage deals or vouchers that offer preferential rates
        for collection at the branch. Some services mean don\u2019t even need to worry
        about a printed voucher \u2013 you can just show the voucher on your mobile
        phone. </p><ul><li><strong>Getting the most from your money</strong></li></ul><br/><p>Avoid
        using credit and debit cards \u2013 some charge 2.5% or more for an ATM transaction
        and the exchange rates may not be favourable. Consider a prepaid currency
        card instead \u2013 but make sure it\u2019s fee free. </p><ul><li><strong>Withdrawing
        cash from ATMs</strong></li></ul><br/><p>Even if you have a card that doesn\u2019t
        impose fees for ATMs, some ATM operators make charges for their use. Think
        ahead. If you have to use a fee charging ATM, plan to withdraw enough currency
        to last for a good few days so that you\u2019re not racking fees </p><ul><li><strong>Say
        \u2018No\u2019 to Dynamic Currency Conversion</strong></li></ul><br/><p>If
        you pay by card, ensure the transaction is conducted in the local currency
        rather than sterling. The practice known as \u2018dynamic currency conversion\u2019
        allows customers to pay for goods and services in their own home currency.
        However, the exchange rate is often less favourable than that offered through
        their credit or debit card. </p><ul><li><strong>Consider locking in the exchange
        rate</strong></li></ul><br/><p>If you are worried about the value of the Pound
        falling further, a prepaid currency card may allow you to lock in the rate
        of exchange at the time you load the card. </p><ul><li><strong>Check the Terms
        and Conditions on prepaid currency cards</strong></li></ul><br/><p>When you
        apply for a prepaid currency card, be careful to check the Ts and Cs. Some
        prepaid cards have charges that apply for their use. Savings made on the rate
        of exchange could be lost through unexpected fees. </p><br/><p><strong>Planning

        be facing a shortfall on original loan payments.","body":"<p><strong>Date
        published: 1 May 2013</strong></p><p class=\"intro\">Do you have an interest-only
        mortgage? It\u2019s estimated that up to one in three borrowers have this
        type of loan .\u00a0 </p><p>Unlike with a repayment mortgage, you only pay
        off the interest accrued on your loan each month, not the capital. This means
        that you still need to pay off the original loan at the end of your mortgage
        term, for example by using an investment scheme. </p><p>The financial regulator
        is concerned that many borrowers who have this type of mortgage have not taken
        steps to ensure that they can repay the original loan at maturity.\u00a0 </p><p><em>\u201cMy
        advice to borrowers is to not bury your head in the sand \u2013 take action
        now,\u201d</em> said Martin Wheatley, chief executive of the FCA. </p><p><em>\u201cUnderstand
        the terms of your mortgage agreement and take control; work out if you can
        repay the outstanding amount when your mortgage matures. But you must engage
        with your lender to discuss how you propose to repay the outstanding loan.\u201d</em></p><p>As
        from April 2014, lenders will no longer be able to sell interest-only mortgages
        to new customers unless they can show they have a credible repayment strategy
        in place.\u00a0 </p><p>Due to this requirement several lenders have stopped
        offering interest-only mortgages. This means it\u2019ll be harder for new
        borrowers to get one of these loans in the future. </p><p><strong>Do you have
        a viable repayment plan?</strong></p><div class=\"callout\"><h3>TAKE ACTION
        </h3><p> It is essential to review your current plan regularly to make sure
        you\u2019re still on target. </p></div><p>If you have an interest-only mortgage
        you should have a repayment plan, which may comprise at least one of the following:
        </p><p>\u2022 <em>Cash ISAs and savings accounts</em> \u2013 you can save
        up to \u00a35,760 in a cash ISA this year, and the interest you earn is exempt
        from income tax. </p><p>\u2022 <em>Stocks and shares ISAs</em> \u2013 you
        can invest up to \u00a311,520 in a stocks and shares ISA, less any money you
        have in a cash ISA </p><p>\u2022 <em>Other investments</em> \u2013 these could
        include shares, unit trusts or bonds. A few years ago endowment policies were
        a popular option too. However, they have suffered from poor performance in
        recent times, leaving many borrowers with a shortfall.\u00a0 </p><p>\u2022
        <em>Pensions</em> \u2013 at retirement, you may be able to use a tax-free
        lump sum from your pension to pay off your loan. </p><p>\u2022 <em>Other assets</em>
        \u2013 you may have money tied up in other properties that you could draw
        on.\u00a0 </p><p>It is essential to review your current plan regularly (e.g.
        at least once a year) to make sure you\u2019re still on target and, if not,
        what you need to do in order to rectify any shortfall.\u00a0 </p><ul><li><a

        you switch to a repayment mortgage?</strong></p><p>If you have an interest-only
        mortgage you may want to consider switching to a part-repayment and part interest-only
        mortgage or moving to a full repayment mortgage. Interest rates have fallen
        over the past year so it may not cost as much as you think to switch, subject

        are several good reasons for investigating whether you may be better off with
        a repayment mortgage: </p><ul><li><em>Interest payments</em> \u2013 as you
        are paying interest on the whole capital, which never reduces, you will pay
        more in interest over the term of the loan than with a repayment mortgage.</li><li><em>Repayment
        mortgages</em> \u2013 with this type of mortgage you can make over-payments
        and so pay off your debt quicker. \u00a0 \u00a0</li><li><em>Housing market</em>
        \u2013 in recent years some house prices have stalled, increasing the risk
        that the value of your home may fall below the value of the original loan,
        a situation called \u2018negative equity\u2019. Having a repayment plan in
        place could mitigate or even remove this risk altogether.\u00a0</li><li><em>Remortgaging</em>
        \u2013 if you don\u2019t have a robust repayment plan in place, you could
        struggle to find a new deal should you wish to switch lender.\u00a0</li></ul><br/><p><strong>What
        to do next</strong></p><p>If you\u2019re concerned about how your investment
        plan is progressing, facing an endowment shortfall or worried about not having
        a proper strategy in place, it not too late to speak to your mortgage lender
        or an independent financial adviser to find out your options.\u00a0 </p><ul><li><a

        young Britons expect to receive inheritance from their parents \u2013 but
        in reality four in ten won\u2019t get a penny, according to new research.
        </p><p>In a study of 2,000 adults, while three out of four people aged 20
        to 35 hope to receive a windfall of around \u00a378,000 when their parents
        pass away, they look set to be disappointed. </p><p>Worrying one in five children
        over the age of 20 are hoping their parents\u2019 wealth will sort out all
        of their money problems, and have completely shelved all financial plans for
        the future as a result. </p><p>Unfortunately for them, almost one in two parents
        aged 50 and over have already had to dip into their savings to get by, and
        four in ten have already been giving their children hand-outs to help them
        with college fees, driving lessons and rent payments. </p><p>The study, carried
        out for Skipton Building Society, shows that almost seven out of ten kids
        expect to inherit their parent\u2019s house when they pass away, while one
        in three think they\u2019ll get the car. </p><div class=\"callout\"><p> More
        than one in two young people have no financial plans for retirement.</p><p>Source:

        receive a cash injection, and as a result more than one in two aren\u2019t
        making any financial plans for a comfortable retirement. </p><p>Indeed, one
        in five of those polled are counting on their parent\u2019s inheritance to
        help them get out of debt, while the same percentage hope they\u2019ll finally
        be able to step foot on the property ladder. </p><p>A one in four people aged
        20 to 35 hope they\u2019ll be able to pay off the mortgage with some inheritance,
        and one in seven are banking on having it to put their own children through
        university. </p><p>Paying off student and car loans, helping their own children
        with a house or car and holidays are just some of the other ways kids intend
        to spend their inheritance \u2013 if they were to get any. </p><p>But the
        statistics show, seven in ten adults aged 50-and-over think savings are better
        spent now, as and when the family needs it. </p><p>As such, while 84% of parents
        would love to be able to leave thousands of pounds to their offspring in order
        to carve out a comfortable future for them, they have chosen to spend much
        of the money on the family now. </p><p>While almost three in five people know
        their children are expecting to receive inheritance, an overwhelming nine
        out of ten think they need to become more responsible for their own future.

        are you managing during these difficult economic times? Did any of the tax
        and benefits changes introduced in April have an impact on your finances?
        Are you worried about your savings being eroded by inflation? </p><p>We\u2019re
        well aware of how stressful money matters can be. Recent research commissioned
        by Mind, the mental health charity, found that almost one in three of us are
        anxious about our finances. </p><p>So, we\u2019ve put together five steps
        you can take to <strong>reduce your outgoings</strong>, <strong>boost your
        savings</strong> and <strong>keep track of your cash</strong>.However you\u2019ve
        been affected by recent changes, our advice should help you achieve your money
        goals. </p><p><strong>1. Make your money go further </strong></p><p>Keeping
        a record of all your income and outgoings might not be fun, but if you stay
        on top of your spending \u2013 from newspapers and treats to your weekly shop
        and essential bills \u2013 you can more easily live within your means. </p><p>With
        a firm grip on your finances you can work out where you need to cut back,
        should you need to. Scrutinising your expenditure might sound daunting, but

        How to keep your borrowing to a minimum </strong></p><p>Many of us borrow
        on a regular basis, often with credit cards, but that doesn\u2019t mean you
        have to pay over the odds. If you\u2019ve built up overdraft and credit card
        debt, check what it\u2019s costing you in interest and whether you can find
        cheaper deals elsewhere. Credit cards, for example, typically attract an annual
        percentage rate (APR) of 17%, but you could be paying even more than this.
        </p><p>It\u2019s worth seeing whether you can shift existing debt to a credit
        card with a lower APR or one charging 0% on balance transfers for an extended
        introductory period. Contact your provider to see what\u2019s available. Plus
        see our guide <a title=\"Paying off your credit and store cards\" href=\"/en/articles/paying-off-your-credit-card\">Paying

        </strong></p><div class=\"callout\"><h3>FRESHEN UP YOUR SAVINGS </h3><p>Grow
        your savings faster with tax-free interest, but be sure to shop around for

        to \u2013 make the most of tax-free savings and investments for you and your
        children or grandchildren. </p><p>ISAs offer a great way to save tax-efficiently,
        as the interest earned is exempt from income tax. This year\u2019s total ISA
        allowance is \u00a311,520, half of which can be put into a cash account. The
        rest or the whole amount can be placed in a stocks and shares ISA. See our

        at your mortgage </strong></p><p>When was the last time you reviewed your
        mortgage? Interest rates are at a historic low, which means there are plenty
        of low mortgages available right now. You could save hundreds \u2013 perhaps
        thousands \u2013 of pounds by shopping around, so it\u2019s a good idea to
        make a habit of reviewing your mortgage each year to check whether you should
        switch to a more competitive rate. Check out our guide <a title=\"Why it pays

        it pays to review your mortgage regularly</a>\u00a0to get started. </p><p>If
        you have an interest-only mortgage, how are you intending to pay off your
        final balance? Are you saving or investing in an ISA or do you have an endowment
        policy? If the latter, you need to ensure that the endowment is performing
        in line with your expectations or whether there is any shortfall that you
        need to fill. </p><p>One way to reduce your mortgage is overpayments. Watch

        pots over the years, it\u2019s always worth reviewing what you have and keeping
        track of it. According to Age UK, nearly one in four UK adults has lost track
        of at least one pension scheme. </p><p>If rifling through your files for pension
        statements doesn\u2019t bear fruit, you can contact the pension provider or
        your previous employer if it\u2019s a workplace pension, but if you\u2019re
        still struggling \u2013 you can\u2019t find the contact details of an old
        employer or you don\u2019t know the pension provider \u2013 you can contact
        the Pension Tracing Service. See our simple step-by-step guide to <a title=\"Trace

        off consolidating your pensions or just moving them to better options. </p>","date":"2013-05-01T15:06:08+00:00"},{"id":"consumers-warned-of-job-and-debt-swindles-scams-awareness-month","title":"Consumers

        system, particularly with the introduction to the commonly called \u2018bedroom
        tax\u2019 and localisation of council tax benefit. </p><p>According to the

        tax bill by charging for re-banding that doesn\u2019t happen. </p><p>Throughout
        the whole of May Citizens Advice Bureaux and Trading Standards across England

        class=\"intro\">Householders embarking on a home improvement project this
        May bank holiday are being urged to check their insurance cover to avoid stumping
        up thousands of pounds to fix DIY disasters. </p><p>Halifax Home Insurance
        recommends homeowners should check their home insurance documents beforehand
        to ensure they know what''s covered. It also warns those who tackle major
        work they are not qualified for risk invalidating their home insurance policy.
        </p><p>Last year the company recorded almost 40,000 accidental damage claims,
        many of which were DIY-related such as spilling paint or drilling through
        pipes. </p><p>In total the insurer paid out almost \u00a313m for accidental
        damage, with each claim costing an average of \u00a3323.00 to fix. May alone
        saw over \u00a31m in accidental damage claims, partly due to botched bank
        holiday home \u2018improvement'' jobs. </p><p>Recent research shows that over
        three in four householders would be confident enough to tackle painting, and
        half would attempt to put up shelves, more than one in ten would fit a new
        kitchen, and one in twenty would be willing to fit a new gas fire themselves
        - something Halifax does not recommend. </p><p>Halifax Home Insurance offers
        the following tips to help those planning to DIY this bank holiday weekend:
        </p><ul><li>Preparation is key - make sure you have all the correct tools
        and equipment for the job before you start to avoid coming unstuck later on</li><li>Plan
        a budget beforehand and stick to it</li><li>Call a professional for jobs involving
        gas, electrical or plumbing work. When choosing a tradesman, ask for references
        and certificates to demonstrate that they are competent</li><li>Contact your
        insurer if any work is being carried out which may alter the structure or
        layout of the home such as an extension or garage, etc</li></ul><p>Accidental
        damage to some parts of the home such as sinks, baths and ceramic hobs is
        included in many home insurance policies, but it is worth considering purchasing
        additional accidental damage cover to protect against common DIY mishaps such
        as spilling paint, drilling through pipes, or putting feet through ceilings.

        out of ten people in this age group who intend to retire are resigned to the
        fact that they will have to work for as long as they can and 8% of those yet
        to retire don\u2019t think they ever will. </p><p>The figures form part of
        a survey which indicates that the majority of UK adults suffer from a condition
        we have dubbed \u2018Pensionitis\u2019 \u2013 a serious apathy towards pensions
        that could leave people struggling financially in retirement. </p><p>The most
        acute sufferers of Pensionitis (almost one in three UK adults) admit to simply
        burying their heads in the sand when it comes to pension planning because
        they don\u2019t understand what it all means. </p><p>Almost two in three UK
        adults admit to being confused by the topic of pensions. </p><p>Seven worrying
        symptoms of Pensionitis </p><p>Adults with pension provision in place still
        exhibit a range of symptoms that could potentially jeopardise their financial
        health in retirement. </p><p><strong>1. \u00a0Financial advantages:</strong>
        The majority of UK adults (55%) don\u2019t understand the tax benefits of
        having a pension </p><p><strong>2.</strong>\u00a0\u00a0<strong>Knowledge:</strong>
        55% of non-retired people with a pension admit they don\u2019t understand
        how their pension contributions are invested </p><p><strong>3.</strong>\u00a0\u00a0<strong>Personal
        Contributions:</strong> 33% of non-retired people with a pension don\u2019t
        know how much they personally contribute towards their pension each month
        </p><p><strong>4.</strong>\u00a0\u00a0<strong>The jargon:</strong> 36% of
        UK adults admit they don\u2019t know what is meant by an \u2018annuity\u2019;
        59% admit they don\u2019t understand the relationship between annuity and
        a pension pot </p><p><strong>5.</strong>\u00a0\u00a0<strong>Pension Providers</strong>:
        28% of those with a pension who aren\u2019t retired don\u2019t know the name
        of their pension provider </p><p><strong>6.</strong>\u00a0\u00a0<strong>Projected
        incomes:</strong> 17% of people with a pension who aren\u2019t retired admit
        they have no idea how to work out what income they are projected to receive
        when they retire </p><p><strong>7.\u00a0</strong><strong>Pension pot check-ups:</strong>
        Around half of non-retired people with a pension (48%) only check the status
        of their pension annually; whilst 4% admit they check it less than once a
        decade </p><p>However, it\u2019s not all bad news. The message that it is
        never too young to start saving into a pension is getting through to the minority.
        Almost two in five adults intending to start a pension claim they will do
        so before their 30th birthday. </p><p><em>\u201cRetirement is inevitable,
        so how you plan to fund it is just too important to ignore. It\u2019s really
        concerning that more than one in ten over 55s who aren\u2019t retired have
        not thought about how they will fund their retirement and worrying that so
        many people are succumbing to Pensionitis,\"</em> said Jackie Spencer, a retirement
        and pension expert at the Money Advice Service. </p><p><em>\u201cThe good
