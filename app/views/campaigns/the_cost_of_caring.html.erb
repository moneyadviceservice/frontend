        The ‘sandwich generation’ is an ever-growing group of adults who care for their ageing parents while supporting their own children. <a href="/files/sandwich-generation-report-final-100613.pdf">Our research</a> reveals that almost a third of carers struggle to cover basic living costs, with over one in five in debt and struggling to cope financially.
      </p>
      <p>
        Here at the Money Advice Service, we offer free and impartial advice for sandwich carers, including guides, tools and calculators.
