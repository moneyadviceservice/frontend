        retirement, found that those retiring in 2013 expect average incomes of \u00a315,300
        per year - \u00a3200 less than the Class of 2012''s expectations. </p><p>According
        to the study, expected retirement incomes have fallen in four of the past

        person entering retirement anticipated an annual income of \u00a318,700. </p><p>The
        real-term fall in incomes, however, is even higher due to rises in living
        costs. According to Prudential, since 2008, inflation has caused prices to
        rise by 14.7 per cent. </p><p>Someone who retired last year would therefore
        need an annual income of \u00a321,400, to have the same buying power as an
        average person entering retirement in 2008. </p><p>Despite expected retirement
        incomes falling nationally overall, they actually increased in certain areas
        of the UK. The most significant year-on-year increases were in Yorkshire and

        has begun a 12 week consultation on quality standards within the debt advice
        sector in the UK. </p><p>We took on responsibility for the co-ordination of
        the sector earlier in 2012, with a remit to improve the accessibility, quality
        and consistency of debt advice. </p><p>The quality of debt advice is recognised
        to vary across the country and the new consultation invites views on a framework
        which will set a benchmark for debt advice delivery and bring about greater
        consistency. </p><p>The framework has been informed by an independent review
        carried out by the Money Advice Trust, which found that there is great diversity
        in the way debt advice is delivered, monitored and accredited. </p><p>It will
        apply to organisations and individuals working in the sector and is designed
        to build upon the good practice which already exists. </p><p>We are proposing
        that three principles for organisations sit at the heart of the framework:
        being receptive to client needs, demonstrating strong governance and promoting
        reflective and on-going learning. </p><p>The framework proposes greater clarity
        around the role profiles of debt advisers and sets out a minimum range of
        skills, knowledge and competencies for individuals working in the sector.
        </p><p>Following the consultation, the Money Advice Service will finalise
        details of the framework. It will then work with those operating in the sector,
        including organisations not currently funded by the Service, to ensure that
        the standards they follow meet the new benchmark. </p><p>By April 2014, organisations
        which receive funding from the Money Advice Service will need to demonstrate
        that the standards they follow are in line with the framework. </p><p><a href=\"/en/static/money-advice-service-consults-on-improving-the-quality-of-debt-advice-in-the-uk\">Read
