  body: "<p> A good credit report could be your ticket to better lending, so it's important to keep track of it and know how to improve your score. </p><p>But new Money Advice Service research shows that not only are too few people checking theirs, many don't know exactly what they are used for.  </p><p>Credit reference agencies produce the reports to be used by lenders to rate the credit worthiness of an individual - put simply, the better your credit rating the lower the risk you will default on any existing or future credit obligations. This means you will be less likely to be <a title=\"Refused credit\" href=\"https://www.moneyadviceservice.org.uk/en/articles/what-to-do-if-you-have-been-refused-a-loan-or-credit-card\">refused credit</a> in the future. </p><h2>What a credit report includes </h2><p>So what exactly is in a credit report? </p><p>They not only include information that financial companies use to verify identity, they also show previous credit history, such as if you’ve defaulted on a loan or any late payments. Companies use this information to help them decide whether to allow you to open an account or offer you credit, and on what terms. </p><p>If you take a credit report out you can expect to see your credit history over the last six years, plus: </p><ul><li>Your name, current and previous addresses (covering the last six years), and date of birth</li><li>Your current account provider and details of any overdrafts you have</li><li>A list of any credit and store cards, loans or mortgages you have</li><li>Details of any late or missed payments</li><li>Public record information, such as County Court Judgments (or Decrees in Scotland), property repossessions and bankruptcies for up to six years after they occur.</li></ul><p>Your credit report may also show whether <a title=\"Protect yourself from fraud\" href=\"https://www.moneyadviceservice.org.uk/en/articles/protecting-yourself-from-scams-and-theft\">your identity has been fraudulently used</a> in the past – if you have reported it to your bank, lender or another financial provider.

These agencies won’t record some sensitive information such as a criminal record, your basic salary or religion. Money Advice Service research reveals 13% of people thought checking for criminal records was the purpose of requesting a credit report. </p><h2>Checklist </h2><p><strong>Have you checked your credit report?</strong> – <a title=\"Too many adults dont check their credit report\" href=\"https://www.moneyadviceservice.org.uk/en/news/do-you-know-your-credit-score-most-uk-adults-havent-checked-theirs-in-five-years\">just one in three has taken out a credit report</a>, so many people risk paying more than necessary because of issues and errors they can rectify. </p><p><strong>How to improve your credit report</strong> – it is possible to <a title=\"How to check and improve your credit report\" href=\"https://www.moneyadviceservice.org.uk/en/news/how-to-improve-your-credit-report-and-get-a-better-deal\">boost your chances of being accepted for credit</a> by taking steps such as by avoiding multiple credit applications and getting on the electoral role. </p><p><strong>Free credit reports</strong> - Money Advice Service website users can get a <a title=\"Free credit report\" href=\"https://www.moneyadviceservice.org.uk/en/static/get-your-free-credit-report?utm_campaign=3735691&amp;utm_content=10198295742&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=Emailvision\">free credit report</a> from two of the main agencies, for a limited period only. </p><p><strong>Myth buster</strong> - <a title=\"Credit report quiz\" href=\"https://www.moneyadviceservice.org.uk/en/tools/quiz-the-truth-about-credit-reports\">take our quiz </a>to see if you are credit savvy. </p><p><strong>Don’t miss out!</strong> - for more money advice and news straight to your inbox, <a title=\"Newsletter\" href=\"https://www.moneyadviceservice.org.uk/en/newsletter-subscriptions/new\">sign up to our emails here</a>. </p><p><em>Photo: PA</em></p>"
