        to need help.</p>\n\n<p>For example, if they’re getting older and finding
        it more difficult to make decisions, or if they’ve been diagnosed with the
        early stages of dementia.</p>\n\n<p>So you need to start thinking about what
        will happen when they can no longer manage.</p>\n\n<p>There are two main options
        – a lasting power of attorney, or a trust.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"appoint-someone-to-make-decisions--lasting-power-of-attorney\">Appoint

        a lasting power of attorney set up as early as possible – it will be impossible
        to set up a lasting power of attorney once someone is unable to manage their
        own affairs.</p>\n\n</div>\n\n<p>Often your first step is to ask the person
        whether they’d consider making a ‘power of attorney’.</p>\n\n<p>This means
        they give someone else permission to control their money for them.</p>\n\n<p>The
        person you want to help has to set up the lasting power of attorney, so you
        need to discuss it with them.</p>\n\n<p>You can reassure them it doesn’t have
        to be used straight away and they can keep control of their own affairs for
        as long as they are able to do so.</p>\n\n<p>It’s essential to set up a lasting
        power of attorney when the person is still well enough to do it.</p>\n\n<p>If
        you wait until they can’t make their own decisions it will be too late and
        you have to apply to a court for permission to manage their finances which

        they can set down more specific rules about how the money can be used.</p>\n\n<p>They

        ","description":"","content":"<p><strong>Tuesday 31 January 2017</strong></p>\n\n<p><strong>Money
        Advice Service announces first projects to receive funding from the new What
        Works Fund initiative.</strong></p>\n\n<p>Projects across the UK will receive
        new funding from the Money Advice Service, helping tens of thousands of people
        manage their money better.</p>\n\n<p>Today, the Money Advice Service announced
        funding for 26 projects, with more to follow in the coming months. The projects,
        which cover every region of the UK, are being funded from the Money Advice
        Service’s new £7m What Works Fund. Funded projects will reach thousands of
        people – from younger people in school, to students and from working age adults
        to those in retirement.</p>\n\n<p>We know that levels of financial capability
        remain stubbornly low - four out of ten adults are not in control of their
        finances and around 16.8 million working age people have less than £100 in
        savings.</p>\n\n<p>However, very little evidence currently exists on the best
        way to address this issue. That is why the What Works Fund aims to build evidence
        and to establish the interventions which best help people to manage their
        money. Ultimately, the aim is to scale up the most effective projects in order
        to improve the levels of financial capability of millions of people across
        the UK.</p>\n\n<p><strong>David Haigh, Director of Financial Capability at
        the Money Advice Service comments:</strong></p>\n\n<p>“This is the first time
        that we have funded projects to gain evidence about how best to help people
        with their money. These projects will reach tens of thousands of people, while
        helping organisations ensure their interventions are truly effective. By increasing
        the effectiveness of what we do, we can better target our collective efforts,
        thereby improving the financial capability of millions across the country.”</p>\n\n<p>“Evidence
        will be gained from a range of approaches, from large-scale digital projects
        that engage with people online, through to one-on-one interventions which
        guide people through a step-by-step process to help them keep on top of their
        finances. The projects will help individuals to budget, saving regularly,
        handle their finances online, manage their credit and build their numeracy
        skills.”</p>\n\n<p>The projects also target segments of society who could
        be vulnerable to falling into financial difficulty, including those with mental
        health issues, those at risk of being homeless and people with long term illnesses.</p>\n\n<p>“We
        know that millions of people across the country are one unexpected bill away
        from seeing their finances spiral out of control – and for those who are already
        vulnerable, that risk is exacerbated. We want to build evidence on how we
        can get these people to engage with their financial situation and avoid them
        ending up in problem debt or with other financial difficulties,” <strong>explained
        Haigh.</strong></p>\n\n<p><strong>Caroline Rookes, Chief Executive for the
        Money Advice Service said:</strong> “There is an urgent need to help people
        gain the skills and confidence they need to make good decisions about their
        money day to day. The insights from these projects will be vital, helping
        organisations to channel their efforts in the right places and to fund and
        deliver interventions that we know make a real difference. This will also
        underpin the money guidance commissioning work to be carried out by the new
        money guidance body which will replace the Money Advice Service.”</p>\n\n<p>“We
        look forward to collaborating not only with projects funded through the What
        Works Fund, but with all organisations that are working to improve levels
        of financial capability. A collective approach is needed to really tackle
        the issues that underpin low financial capability in the UK.”</p>\n\n<p><strong>-ENDS-</strong></p>\n\n<p><strong>For

        develop their financial capability, and to directly supporting people to create
        a lasting power of attorney; to limit their risk of being scammed; and, to
        help them learn how to safely use online financial services. If anyone would

        Collier, National Director, Campaign for Learning:</strong></p>\n\n<p>“Families
        provide the most important opportunity for most children to see, talk and
        learn about money; what parents do really matters in helping children make
        positive financial choices as they grow up. We are excited to be working with
        the Money Advisory Service and the What Works Fund to deliver the Family Fortunes
        project, because it will enable us to really understand what works in helping
        parents build brighter financial futures for themselves and their children.”</p>\n\n<p><strong>Paul
