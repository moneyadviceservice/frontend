        regularly","description":"A regular savings habit makes your savings grow
        fast \u2013 getting started is quick and easy","body":"<img src=\"/images/why-it-pays-to-save-regularly.png\"/><p
        class=\"intro\">If you save regularly, you\u2019ll quickly find that your
        savings add up and keep growing. Get into the habit and watch your money turn
        into more money. </p><h2>Make saving a habit </h2><div class=\"callout\"><p>Getting
        into a regular savings habit is more important than how much you put away
        \u2013 you will be surprised how quickly a few pounds each month builds up!
        </p></div><p>The easiest way to get your savings working for you is to set
        things up so that you automatically add a little bit each month to your savings.
        That way you won\u2019t have to remember to make the payment and you won\u2019t
        be tempted to skip a month. Before you know it, you\u2019ll have built up
        a solid chunk of savings. </p><p>The quickest way to do this is to set up
        a standing order (a regular payment) from a bank current account into your
        chosen savings account. </p><p><div class=\"add-action\"><a href=\"/en/articles/direct-debits-and-standing-orders\">Find

        it on pay day </h2><p>The best time to put a bit of money aside is just after
        you\u2019ve been paid, so set up your standing order to go out on, or just
        after pay day. </p><p>Or ask your workplace if they have a savings scheme
        \u2013 and join it if they do. This makes saving even easier, because the
        money comes straight out of your pay, just like your tax and National Insurance
        contributions. </p><p><div class=\"add-action\"><a href=\"/en/articles/workplace-investment-schemes\">More

        /></div></form> </div></p><h2>Earning interest on interest </h2><p>As your
        savings build up, they\u2019ll grow faster\u2013 even if you\u2019re only
        paying in the same regular amount. This is because each time the interest
        earned on your money is paid into your account it starts earning interest
        too. </p><p>This interest-on-interest is called compound interest, and over
        the longer term it makes a big difference to how much your savings are worth.
        </p><h2>How much can you afford to save? </h2><p>If you\u2019ve got money
        left over at the end of each week or month then great - you\u2019ve already
        got your starting point. You\u2019ll be able to save this amount \u2013 and
        maybe even more. </p><p>But even if there\u2019s usually nothing left, it
        doesn\u2019t mean you can\u2019t save \u2013 it\u2019s not easy to change
        how much money you have coming in but most people <strong>can </strong>change
        how much goes out. To get tips on how to cut back and <strong>unlock your

        /></div></form> </div></p><h2>What about regular investing? </h2><p>You can
        make regular payments from as little as \u00a325 a month into investment products,
        such as a Stocks and Shares ISA or Unit Trust Investment Funds. Investment
        products are for the longer term and are really only suitable if you already
        have enough cash savings to keep you going for 3-6 months if needs be. Investments
        generally outperform cash savings over the longer term, but their value can
        rise and fall, so you have to be prepared to take on some risk. </p><p><div
