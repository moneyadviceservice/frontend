        class=\"intro\"><img src=\"/images/managing-money-if-your-job-is-at-risk.png\"/>Whether
        your job is already at risk or you''re worrying about potential cuts, one
        of the most important things you can do at this time is to take stock of your
        finances and, in doing so, start to take control. </p><h2>Step 1 \u2013 Take
        stock </h2><p>If you don''t already have a budget \u2013 listing all your
        income and spending \u2013 now''s the time to do it. Take care here. Most
        people underestimate how much they actually spend each month. </p><p>This
        may seem quite a daunting task, but it really is an essential first step.
        Anything else is the financial equivalent of sticking your head in the sand
        and will only result in nasty surprises later on. </p><p><div class=\"add-action\"><a

        is also a good time to start thinking about how your budget will be affected
        if you lose your job. As your income will be a lot less, it\u2019s a good
        idea to work out what spending you\u2019ll need to cut back on so that you
        don\u2019t spend more than your income.\u00a0 </p><p>Cutting back now could
        also let you build up a savings cushion to help you get by if you lose your
        job. </p><p>Take a close look at what you spend your money on and divide it
        into essential and non-essential items. </p><p>For the <strong>essentials</strong>
        \u2013 things like food and energy bills \u2013 try shopping around to get
        a better deal elsewhere. </p><ul><li><a title=\"Save money on your gas and

        \u2013 look at Direct Debits that go out of your account each month, things
        like gym membership and magazine subscriptions. Now think about whether you''re
        getting value for money out of all of them. If not, cancel them. </p><p>Next
        try listing the smaller non-essential items you buy each day \u2013 take-away
        coffees, bottled water or drinks after work. Put them in order of priority.
        Pick off the lower priority items first and cut them out one at a time. You
        will be surprised how much you can save by cutting back on just these items.

        if you find yourself without a job. So seize the moment \u2013 now''s the
        time to look at all your debts. Switch lenders to get the best rates and look
        at paying off as much of the debt as you can, but watch out for early repayment
        charges. </p><ul><li><a title=\"Find out more about cutting the cost of your

        </h2><p>Check for any mortgage payment protection insurance (MPPI), payment
        protection insurance (PPI), or short-term income protection (STIP) insurance
        you may have previously taken out. If you lose your job or are too ill to
        work, you may be able to make a claim. </p><p>In the past, because of the
        way payment protection policies were sold, you may not realise that you have
        this cover. Ask your lender whether your mortgage, loan or credit card is
        covered by insurance. </p><p>If you have insurance and your claim is refused,
        you may have been mis-sold the policy and could be eligible to claim compensation.

        a savings cushion to see you through the lean times </h2><p>Ideally, aim to
        have between three and six months of your living expenses saved in an easy
        access, high-interest bank or building society account. Even a smaller amount
        will be useful. Having cash in the bank is always good, especially if you''re
        going to have a period of time on a reduced income. </p><ul><li><a href=\"/en/articles/top-tips-for-choosing-savings-accounts\">Top
        tips for choosing savings accounts</a></li></ul><h2>Step 6 \u2013 Look at
        ways of making money </h2><p>Think about other sources of income you can tap
        into. For example, did you know that if you have a spare room, you could rent
        it out and not pay tax on the first \u00a34,250 of rental income? You\u2019ll
        need permission from your mortgage provider or landlord to have a lodger and
        you should let your buildings and contents insurance companies know. </p><ul><li><a
