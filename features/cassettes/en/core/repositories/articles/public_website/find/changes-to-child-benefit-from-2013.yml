        people earning \u00a350,000+","description":"The rules for Child Benefit changed
        in January 2013 - find out how the changes affect you and what your options
        are","body":"<p class=\"intro\"><img alt=\"Changes to Child Benefit from 2013\"
        src=\"/images/changes-to-child-benefit-from-2013.jpg\"/>If either you or your
        partner has an income of more than \u00a350,000 a year then you have to pay
        back some or all of your Child Benefit in the form of extra Income Tax. Read
        on to find out more. </p><h2>You and your partner each earn less than \u00a350,000
        per year </h2><p>If you and your partner each has an income of less than \u00a350,000
        a year, you will receive the full amount of Child Benefit without having to
        pay any of it back. </p><h2>Either you or your partner earns between \u00a350,000
        and \u00a360,000 per year\u00a0 </h2><p>If either you or your partner has
        an income of between \u00a350,000 and \u00a360,000 a year each, you have to
        pay a proportion of your Child Benefit back in extra Income Tax. </p><h3>How
        does this work? </h3><p>You still get paid the full amount of Child Benefit
        each month (or each week if you''re paid weekly). However, whichever one of
        you has the higher income has to pay more Income Tax to repay the proportion
        of Child Benefit you''re no longer entitled to. </p><p>You need to fill in
        a Self Assessment tax return so that HM Revenue &amp; Customs (HMRC) can calculate
        the amount of extra Income Tax you have to pay. </p><h3>How much do you have
        to pay back? </h3><p>Basically, you pay back 1% of your family''s Child Benefit
        for every extra \u00a3100 of income over \u00a350,000. </p><p><strong>For
        example </strong></p><p>Katya and Leroy have a baby. Katya is staying at home
        to look after the baby. Leroy earns \u00a351,000 a year. Leroy has to pay
        extra tax to repay some of their Child Benefit. His income is 10 x \u00a3100
        over the limit, so the extra tax is 10% of their Child Benefit of \u00a320.30
        per week. He pays extra tax of \u00a3105 a year. </p><div class=\"add-action\"><span

        </div><h2>Either you or your partner earns more than \u00a360,000 per year\u00a0
        </h2><p>If either you or your partner has an income of more than \u00a360,000
        a year, you have to repay all of your Child Benefit as Income Tax. </p><h3>How
        does this work?\u00a0 </h3><p>You still get paid the full amount of Child
        Benefit each month (or each week if you''re paid weekly). However, whichever
        one of you has the higher income has to pay back the full amount in the form
        of Income Tax. </p><p>You need to fill in a Self Assessment tax return so
        that HM Revenue &amp; Customs (HMRC) can calculate the extra Income Tax you
        have to pay. </p><h2>What to do if you''re a new parent </h2><p>Make sure
        you still put in your claim for Child Benefit - even if you''re earning over
        \u00a350,000 and you''ve decided not to take the payments. This is really
        important because if you don\u2019t, you will miss out on: </p><ul><li>National
        Insurance credits that protect your entitlement to State Pension</li><li>other
        benefits such as Guardian''s Allowance</li><li>your child being automatically
        issued with a National Insurance number before their 16th birthday</li></ul><a
        title=\"Claiming Child Benefit\" href=\"/en/articles/claiming-child-benefit\">See
        our guide Claiming Child Benefit to find out more about how to claim</a><h2>If
        you want your Child Benefit payments to stop </h2><p>You could choose not
        to receive your Child Benefit payments any more. </p><ul class=\"yes-no\"><li
        class=\"yes\">This avoids the hassle of paying additional tax.</li><li class=\"yes\">You
        won''t have to complete a tax return.</li><li class=\"no\">If your income
        is between \u00a350,000 and \u00a360,000, you''ll end up out of pocket since
        you''ll be giving up the proportion of Child Benefit that you are still entitled
        to.</li></ul><h3>How to stop your payments </h3><p>You should let HMRC know
        you want to stop your payments. </p><ul><li><a title=\"HMRC website\" target=\"_blank\"
        data-link-type=\"external\" href=\"http://www.hmrc.gov.uk/childbenefitcharge/stopchbpayments.htm\">Go
        to the HMRC website and stop your Child Benefit payments</a></li></ul><h2>If
        you want to carry on getting your Child Benefit </h2><p>You could choose to
        keep your Child Benefit payments. </p><ul class=\"yes-no\"><li class=\"yes\">If
        your income is between \u00a350,000 and \u00a360,000, you will still get however
        much you''re entitled to.</li><li class=\"yes\">Even if you''re earning over
        \u00a360,000, if you put your Child Benefit aside in a savings account you
        can earn interest on the money before you have to pay your tax bill.</li><li
        class=\"no\">You will need to pay the extra tax.</li><li class=\"no\">You''ll
        have to complete a tax return.</li></ul><h3>Register for Self Assessment </h3><p>If
        you decide to carry on getting your payments you need to register for Self
        Assessment. </p><ul><li><a title=\"HMRC website\" target=\"_blank\" data-link-type=\"external\"
        href=\"http://www.hmrc.gov.uk/sa/register.htm\">Find out more about registering
        for Self Assessment on the HMRC website</a></li></ul><p>Ideally, you should
        put your Child Benefit payments aside in a high interest savings account until
        you know how much you need to pay back. </p><ul><li><a title=\"Comparison
