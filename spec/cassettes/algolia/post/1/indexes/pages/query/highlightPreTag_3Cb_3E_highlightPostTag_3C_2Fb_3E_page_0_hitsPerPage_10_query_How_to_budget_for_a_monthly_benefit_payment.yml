        household income and outgoings is a must if you want to make sure you can
        pay all your bills and manage until the end of the month.</p>\n\n<p>Even if
        you’re already budgeting, changes to the benefit system will probably mean
        you need to make some changes to the way you go about it.</p>\n\n<p>Just to
        remind you, the following benefits:</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>Income Support</li>\n  <li>Child
        Tax Credit</li>\n  <li>Housing Benefit</li>\n  <li>Working Tax Credit</li>\n  <li>Income-based
        Jobseekers Allowance</li>\n  <li>Income-related Employment and Support Allowance</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>are
        being phased out for people of working age and replaced with Universal Credit.</p>\n\n<p>Universal
        Credit will be paid in a single monthly payment to each household.</p>\n\n<p>So
        if you currently work out your budget weekly or fortnightly, you’ll have to
        start looking at your incomings and outgoings across the whole month</p>\n\n<p>And
        if you’re using different benefit payments to cover set expenses, you’ll need
        to get used to having a single payment to cover everything</p>\n\n<p>Universal
        Credit is already available for single people, couples and families in some
        areas of the country.</p>\n\n<p>It mostly affects people who are newly unemployed.
        If you’re already claiming benefits you will be told when Universal Credit
        will affect you.</p>\n\n<p>In the meantime, it makes sense to get ready for
        the changes by getting to grips with a monthly budget.</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>Find

        Look at the paperwork relating to any benefits and tax credits you get at

        these payments are weekly, fortnightly, four-weekly or monthly.</li>\n  <li>\n<strong>Wages</strong>.
        If you’re working, check your payslips and jot down your salary (after tax
        and other deductions).</li>\n  <li>\n<strong>Other income</strong>. If you
        have any other income coming in, for example from a pension or child maintenance

        to work out your outgoings</h3>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>\n<strong>Household bills:</strong>
        Gather together all the bills you pay so you can see the exact amounts. If
        your rent is currently being paid for you, be prepared to start including
        this in your budget soon. With Universal Credit, you’ll have to start paying
        your landlord yourself.</li>\n  <li>\n<strong>Living costs:</strong> The more
        exact you can be here, the better. For things like grocery shopping, it’s
        probably enough to look at how much you spend across a few weeks and work
        out an average. But for things like school uniform and other one-off costs,
        you’ll need to look at what you spend across the whole year and divide by
        12 to get an average monthly amount.</li>\n  <li>\n<strong>Insurance and loan
        repayments:</strong> Track down anything you pay on a regular basis such as
        home insurance, catalogue payments and credit card payments and make a note
        of them.</li>\n  <li>\n<strong>Children and pets:</strong> This includes things
        like childcare, after-school clubs, and school trips. Some of these costs
        will be regular and others will be occasional so you’ll need to work out an
        average. If you have pets, add up everything you spend on their food, vets’
        bills, etc.</li>\n  <li>\n<strong>Travel:</strong> If you have a car, make
        sure you include all the costs (including some like car tax – commonly known
