        years old and lives at home with his Mum. He does not contribute to the household

        out with friends.</p>\n\n<p>Paul thinks week to week about money and only
        plans ahead if there is something he really wants to do. For instance, if
        there is a concert for which he wants tickets.</p>\n\n<p>Being paid every
        Friday means all of the week’s earnings are available over the weekend and
        if he spends a lot he has to get through until payday without any funds.</p>\n\n<p>At
        times he borrows money from his family with the intention of paying them back
        when he next gets paid. The reality is that while he pays his sister back,
        he rarely repays his mother.</p>\n\n<div class=\"callout callout--tip\">\n  <span

        will then decide if he needs to borrow money to avoid going beyond his overdraft
        limit. He rarely enters credit in his account.</p>\n\n<p>Paul and his friends
        have used pay-day lenders a few times, the last occasion for Paul was when
        he took out a loan of £70 for a night out, paying back around £100.</p>\n\n<p>Paul
        knows that as he is in temporary work this could be risky if he borrowed a
        large amount and then couldn’t get more work, although ultimately he is confident
        that his family would help him.</p>\n\n<p>He does not have any concrete financial
        goals and while he would like a house and is always on the lookout for a job
        which would pay more, he is not taking any proactive steps to achieve this.</p>\n\n<p>For
        Paul to save money he would, in reality, not be able to go out at all; something
        he isn’t prepared to consider at the moment.</p>\n\n<p>Paul thinks that the
        way he approaches his finances is typical for someone his age and isn’t worried

        going out, buying own-brand products, and selling her car and other possessions.

        enough money for all her needs, and enjoys making home improvements which
        she saves up for. This investment is driven by the feeling that she needs
        to keep the house in good condition for when she leaves it to her daughter.</p>\n\n<div
        class=\"callout callout--tip\">\n  <span class=\"callout__icon\" aria-hidden=\"true\">?</span>\n  <p>“Some
        goes into my current account if I want to buy things and some goes into my
        savings. You’ve got to have a system…”</p>\n\n</div>\n\n<p>She keeps her system
        for dealing with money very simple, drawing out the same amount each month
        to cover her living expenses. The remainder is withdrawn at the end of the
        month and paid into her Savings Account. She has been using this system for
        a number of years.</p>\n\n<p>Throughout the month she keeps track of her money
        by noting down the main expenditures leaving her account (such as car tax,
        house and washing machine insurance), though she has very few outgoings having
        downsized 11 years ago to become mortgage-free.</p>\n\n<p>Barbara pays her
        household bills in cash on a specific week of each month after receiving her
        pension because she prefers to spend money this way rather than on a credit
        card, so she can keep track.</p>\n\n<p>Other costs are set up as direct debits
        so she does not have to worry about them. She knows broadly how much she has
        in her account.</p>\n\n<p>She likes her dealings with money to be handled
        face to face and prefers not to be involved in technology or terminology that
        she doesn’t understand or trust.</p>\n\n<p>She recognises this is different
        to her children and grandchildren but has no intention of changing. She understands
        this difference between her generation and those that follow, but feels that
        younger generations have a different, more reckless attitude towards money
        and spending.</p>\n","published_at":"2015-03-25T13:08:35.000Z","objectID":"/en/corporate/money-lives-barbara","_highlightResult":{"title":{"value":"<b>Money</b>

        the Money Advice Service announces <strong>over £30 million to fund the delivery
        of free debt advice across the UK in 2013/14</strong>. The largest funding
        agreement is with Citizens Advice - £23m will be allocated to fund its debt
        advice projects in England and Wales (the same amount allocated in 2012/13).</p>\n\n<p><strong>England
        and Wales</strong> The Service has signed grant agreements worth over <strong>£26
        million</strong> with six lead debt advice partners in England and Wales:
        Citizens Advice, including Citizens Advice Cymru, Capitalise, Community Finance
        Solutions, Greater Merseyside Money Advice Partnership, Bristol Debt Advice
        Centre and East Midlands Money Advice. Overall, during 2013/14, 150,000 people
        will benefit from free debt advice provided by the partners.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Scotland</strong>
        The Service will allocate £2.35m to fund the delivery of debt advice through
        a partnership with the Scottish Legal Aid Board (SLAB). This funding builds
        on the Service’s existing partnership with SLAB, and it will finance new projects
        to help groups of over-indebted people in Scotland including those who face
        barriers to accessing help to deal with their debts, such as: people with
        complex mental health needs, physical disabilities, and those experiencing
        domestic abuse. In addition, the Service will commit £350,000 to other projects
        in Scotland, including a pilot to integrate financial capability support into
        insolvency practices.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Northern Ireland</strong> The Service
        will commit almost £800,000 to extend its partnership with the Department
        of Enterprise, Trade and Investment in order to continue advice delivered
        by Advice NI last year.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Caroline Siarkiewicz, Head of the
        Money Advice Service’s Debt Advice programme</strong>, said; “In a time of
        turbulence in the debt advice sector, when many organisations are withdrawing
        or cutting-back funding, we are proud to continue our support for the essential
        services provided by our debt advice partners. We know that the services we
        fund make a huge difference to the lives of over indebted people. We want
        to thank our partners who have worked tirelessly with us over the last year
        and we look forward to continuing our work together this year.”</p>\n\n<p><strong>Gillian
        Guy, Chief Executive of Citizens Advice</strong>, said; “As pay freezes, benefit
        cuts and price rises wreak havoc on household budgets, we’re expecting to
        see many more people who need support dealing with debt. Citizens Advice Bureaux
        helped with over two million debt problems last year, and this funding means
        we can continue to giving our expert advice to help tackle money problems.”</p>\n\n<p><strong>Lindsay
        Montgomery, Chief Executive of Scottish Legal Aid Board (SLAB)</strong>, said;
        “We are delighted to have been asked once again by the Money Advice Service
        to allocate this significant amount of funding through a partnership grants
        programme. We very much welcome this opportunity to build upon the success
        of our existing grants programme by establishing a new programme to improve
        support for people across Scotland who need specialist help to deal with debt
        issues.”</p>\n\n<p>In addition to the £30.6 million funding for debt advice
        projects, £3.8m is being allocated to the Money Advice Service’s work to co-ordinate
        and improve quality and consistency across the debt advice sector, including
        projects focussed on data management, evaluation, standards and triage.</p>\n\n<p><strong>NOTES
        TO EDITORS</strong></p>\n\n<p>1. The Money Advice Service is grant funding
        the following partners for the second year in a row: Citizens Advice, Capitalise,
        Community Finance Solutions, Greater Merseyside Money Advice Partnership,
        Bristol Debt Advice Centre and East Midlands Money Advice. 2013/14 will also
        be the second year during which the Service has worked with SLAB and Advice
        NI.</p>\n\n<p>2. £23m will go to projects run by Citizens Advice, £18m through
        the Service’s grant agreement with Citizens Advice, and the remainder through
        projects funded through the Service’s other lead debt advice partners.</p>\n\n<p>3.
        The Service’s Business Plan for 2013/14, published in March, stated that its
        debt advice delivery partners were on-track to deliver almost 175,000 sessions
        across the UK in 2012/13. Final performance figures for 2012/13 will be published
        shortly.</p>\n\n<p>4. The partners which the Service funds are succeeding
        in delivering positive outcomes for clients at the same time as increasing
        the number of sessions provided. An independent evaluation by <a href=\"https://www.moneyadviceservice.org.uk/files/optimisa-report-final-for-publication.pdf\">Optimisa</a>
        of their service delivery in England and Wales found that over 90% of clients
        took action to address their over-indebtedness after receiving advice.</p>\n\n<p>5.
        Full details of the Service’s budget for debt advice in 2013/14 are set out
