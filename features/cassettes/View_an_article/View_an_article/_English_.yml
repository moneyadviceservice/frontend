        Help to Buy mortgage schemes for first-time buyers and current owners are
        now underway - our guide reveals all","body":"<p class=\"intro\"><img alt=\"Help
        to Buy schemes - couple with keys to house\" src=\"/images/help-to-buy-schemes---everything-you-need-to-know.jpg\"/>We
        explain what you need to know about Help to Buy - the government''s schemes
        aimed at first-time buyers with low deposits and current owners with limited
        equity. Read on for more Help to Buy information. </p><h2>Help to Buy Scheme
        - What is it? </h2><p>Help to Buy - the two main schemes: </p><ul><li><strong>Equity
        loans</strong> - the government lends you up to a fifth of the value of a
        new-build home in England. A similar equity loan scheme is available in Scotland,
        for properties valued up to \u00a3400,000.</li><li><strong>Mortgage guarantees</strong>
        - the government agrees to cover part of your mortgage if you only have a
        small deposit, taking on the default risk should you fall behind with payments.
        The property can be new-build or pre-owned and located in England, Northern
        Ireland, Scotland and Wales.</li></ul><h2>Help to Buy - The background </h2><div
        class=\"callout\"><h3>DID YOU KNOW? </h3><p>In 1985, average first-time buyers
        needed a deposit of 5% to buy a home - in 2012, this had increased to 20%
        <br/><strong>Source: HM Treasury </strong></p></div><p>Help to Buy is expected
        to help make up for the lack of higher loan-to-value products available. </p><p>While
        it\u2019s still occasionally possible for people with a deposit of only 5%
        to get on the property ladder, the government felt there should be more competition
        between mortgage lenders to provide greater choice to home buyers. </p><p>Savings
        rates and wage increases are also well below the rate of inflation, making
        it harder for buyers to save a deposit. </p><p>Another big reason for the
        introduction of the scheme comes down to current rises in house prices. </p><p>Help
        to Buy has so far been very successful, putting it on track to meet the government\u2019s
        target of 74,000 homes by 2016. </p><p><div class=\"add-action\"><a href=\"/en/articles/help-to-buy-schemes-faqs\">Help

        you\u2019re thinking of applying for the Help to Buy mortgage guarantee scheme,
        you\u2019ll need to consider the following: </p><ul><li>Borrowers will need
        to pass affordability checks with mortgage lenders. This varies by lender,
        but usually involves them checking that you\u2019ll still be able to meet
        payments should interest rates go up.</li><li>Borrowers will need to state
        that they have no interest in any other property worldwide, or won\u2019t
        have by the time they complete on a mortgage guarantee scheme mortgage product.</li><li>You
        may be able to apply if you''ve had minor credit problems in the past, but
        you\u2019ll still need to pass the mortgage lender\u2019s credit checks.</li><li>Borrowers
        need to have at least a 5% deposit, and be able to cover costs, for example
        Stamp Duty and any legal and valuation costs.</li><li>If you want to rent
        out the property you\u2019re going to buy, the Help to Buy schemes are not
        suitable for you.</li></ul><h2>Alternatives to Help to Buy </h2><p><div class=\"add-action\"><a

        about Help to Buy? Read our most frequently asked questions about the new
        government schemes.","body":"<p class=\"intro\"><img alt=\"Help to Buy schemes
        - bunch of keysand house keyring\" src=\"/images/help-to-buy-schemes---faqs.jpg\"/>Confused
        about the government''s Help to Buy initiative and how it might affect you?
        We answer some of the most frequently asked questions about the schemes. </p><h2>1.
        Does Help to Buy make it easier for me to buy a property?\u00a0 </h2><p>Yes
        - as long as you have at least a 5% deposit saved and can prove that you can
        afford the mortgage payments. </p><p>You\u2019ll also need to meet the mortgage
        provider\u2019s own lending conditions \u2013 these can vary between provider.
        </p><h2>2. Does Help to Buy cover anywhere outside of England? </h2><p>The
        Help to Buy equity loan scheme is only available in England. The Scottish
        Parliament has recently announced a similar scheme with a property price cap
        of \u00a3400,000. </p><p>The Help to Buy mortgage guarantee scheme is available
        across the UK and includes Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland. </p><h2>3.
        Would I be better using the equity loan or mortgage guarantee? </h2><p>This
        really depends on your needs.\u00a0 </p><p>The equity loan scheme can only
        be used for new build flats and houses, while the mortgage guarantee scheme
        can be used for both new build and pre-owned property. </p><p>Speak with a
        mortgage adviser to help decide which scheme is most suited to you. </p><h2>4.
        I need to sell my home to buy a bigger one - do I qualify? </h2><p>Yes - both
        schemes are available to existing home owners as well as first-time buyers
        as long as the property price is not more that \u00a3600,000 (\u00a3400,000
        for the equity loan scheme in Scotland) </p><h2>5. Will I have difficulty
        selling my home if it was bought through the mortgage guarantee scheme? </h2><p>No
        - buying a home through the mortgage guarantee scheme won\u2019t have an impact
        on its future saleability. </p><p>As there is no shared ownership, the resale
        of the property will be the same as any other property with a standard mortgage.
        </p><h2>6. Will I find it hard to get another mortgage when I move? </h2><p>If
        you borrow up to 95% of a property\u2019s value and it later falls or doesn\u2019t
        increase in value, you may find it difficult to move at a future time. </p><p>You
        can only take out a repayment mortgage through the mortgage guarantee scheme,
        so the amount you borrow gradually reduces over time. This means that by the
        time you come to sell you should have some additional equity in the property,
        even if house prices haven\u2019t gone up. </p><p>You can discuss this - and
        also the possibility of making additional payments to reduce your mortgage
        quicker - with your mortgage lender. </p><h2>7. Will my mortgage payments
        go up after the guarantee scheme ends? </h2><p>No - the mortgage guarantee
        scheme won\u2019t affect your future mortgage rates. </p><p>If you\u2019re
        worried about mortgage payments going up, you can ask if the lender offers
        fixed rates. </p><p>It\u2019s important you know when your mortgage rate is
        due to go up - your mortgage lender or broker has the duty to let you know
        this before you agree to go ahead. Always make sure to discuss your mortgage
        rates with your lender. </p><h2>8. Would I be better off renting, or buying
        through Help to Buy? </h2><p>This depends on your individual circumstances.
        </p><p>The two Help to Buy schemes are designed to help people who have already
        made the decision to buy and who have a deposit of at least 5%. </p><h2>9.
        I need to move this year \u2013 is the guarantee scheme right for me? </h2><p>You
        should let your mortgage lender or broker know of your need to move this year
        as they would be well placed to let you know if this is possible or not. </p><h2>10.
        Do I need to know which lenders are signed up to the mortgage guarantee scheme?
        </h2><p>You can apply for the mortgage guarantee scheme through any participating
        lender. </p><p>You can find more information on lenders taking part and eligibility
        on the <a title=\"Help to Buy website\" target=\"_blank\" data-link-type=\"external\"

        aimed at first-time buyers with low deposits and current owners with limited
        equity. Read on for more Help to Buy information. </p><h2>Help to Buy Scheme
        - What is it? </h2><p>Help to Buy - the two main schemes: </p><ul><li><strong>Equity
        loans</strong> - the government lends you up to a fifth of the value of a
        new-build home in England. A similar equity loan scheme is available in Scotland,
        for properties valued up to \u00a3400,000.</li><li><strong>Mortgage guarantees</strong>
        - the government agrees to cover part of your mortgage if you only have a
        small deposit, taking on the default risk should you fall behind with payments.
        The property can be new-build or pre-owned and located in England, Northern
        Ireland, Scotland and Wales.</li></ul><h2>Help to Buy - The background </h2><div
        class=\"callout\"><h3>DID YOU KNOW? </h3><p>In 1985, average first-time buyers
        needed a deposit of 5% to buy a home - in 2012, this had increased to 20%
        <br/><strong>Source: HM Treasury </strong></p></div><p>Help to Buy is expected
        to help make up for the lack of higher loan-to-value products available. </p><p>While
        it\u2019s still occasionally possible for people with a deposit of only 5%
        to get on the property ladder, the government felt there should be more competition
        between mortgage lenders to provide greater choice to home buyers. </p><p>Savings
        rates and wage increases are also well below the rate of inflation, making
        it harder for buyers to save a deposit. </p><p>Another big reason for the
        introduction of the scheme comes down to current rises in house prices. </p><p>Help
        to Buy has so far been very successful, putting it on track to meet the government\u2019s
        target of 74,000 homes by 2016. </p><p><div class=\"add-action\"><a href=\"/en/articles/help-to-buy-schemes-faqs\">Help
