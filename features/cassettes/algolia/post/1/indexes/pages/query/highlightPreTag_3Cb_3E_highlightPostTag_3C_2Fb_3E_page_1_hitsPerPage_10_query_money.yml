        Service Business Plan 2013-14","content":"<p>The Money Advice Service has
        published its business plan for 2013-14.</p>\n\n<p>We are required, under
        the Financial Services Act 2010, to produce an annual business plan, setting
        out our objectives, priorities and budget for the year ahead. Having undertaken
        a public consultation on the draft plan from those that have an interest in
        our work, and with final approval by the Financial Services Authority, we
        have reflected recommendations made. The plan outlines the Service’s vision,
        working in partnership with other organisations who share the same ambition.</p>\n\n<p>We
        will:</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>Continue to develop our universal, free and impartial
        service, providing information and advice on a range of money topics to people
        across the UK, on the web, over the phone and face-to-face.</li>\n  <li>Target
        younger people and lower income families in particular, with tailored tools,
        information and advice designed to get more people saving, managing their
        debt better, preparing better for retirement, protecting their assets and
        providing for their dependents in around 480,000 cases.</li>\n  <li>Encourage
        people to review their money regularly, helping up to 400,000 people to make
        a budget plan.</li>\n  <li>Continue to grant-fund debt advice provision, making
        it quicker and easier to access, helping 150,000 people throughout the year
        in England and Wales, and more in Scotland and Northern Ireland.</li>\n  <li>Help
        young people become more money savvy, including developing tools for school
        leavers, and helping parents teach their children about the importance of
        managing money.</li>\n  <li>Develop a new UK strategy for financial capability,
        providing a framework to bring organisations together to help people across
        the country become more financially capable.</li>\n  <li>Provide a more efficient
        service, reducing our overall budget by over £2.5m compared to 2012/13.</li>\n  <li>Do
        all of this in partnership with other organisations who share our commitment
        to better money management.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p><a href=\"/files/the-money-advice-service-business-plan-2013-14-final-v3.pdf\">Read
