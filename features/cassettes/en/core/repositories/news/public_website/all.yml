        women feel financially worse off than they did a year ago, according to a
        new report from Savvywoman.","body":"<p class=\"intro\"> Four in ten women
        feel financially worse off than they did a year ago, according to a new report
        from SavvyWoman.\u00a0 </p><p><em>The Women &amp; Money Report</em> shows
        women are taking longer to recover from the financial crisis, and feel less
        likely to be able to retire at their preferred age of 62. </p><h2>Who holds
        the purse strings? </h2><p>More than two in five women with a partner said
        they control long-term family finances, juggling the mortgage, pensions, savings
        and other investments. Half of all men surveyed said they managed the money.
        However, more women than men said they are in charge of the day-to-day home
        budget. </p><p>For tips on how to control your household spending, visit our
        <a title=\"Budget planner\" href=\"https://www.moneyadviceservice.org.uk/en/tools/budget-planner\">Budget
        planner</a>. </p><h2>Salary worries </h2><p>When it comes to wages, 39% of
        women say they are worse off than a year ago compared with 32% of men. </p><p>Even
        over a relatively short period of time \u2013 from early February to mid-April
        \u2013 there are differences in how men and women view their financial circumstances.
        In general, men are more likely to feel optimistic. </p><p>Women in their
        20s are more likely to be optimistic about money than those in their 30s and
        40s, while the 55-plus age group tend to feel no better or worse off. Across
        all age groups women feel worse off than men. </p><h2>What would you do with
        \u00a3100,000? </h2><p>Just over a third of men and women would put some or
        all of a \u00a3100,000 windfall into <a title=\"Savings accounts\" href=\"https://www.moneyadviceservice.org.uk/en/articles/top-tips-for-choosing-savings-accounts\">savings
        accounts</a> or <a title=\"Cash ISAs\" href=\"https://www.moneyadviceservice.org.uk/en/articles/cash-isas\">cash
        ISA</a>, according to the report. Women are less likely to invest in share-based
        investments, with just over one in ten saying they\u2019d choose this option,
        compared to two in ten men. However, women are slightly more likely to invest
        in a second property. </p><p>Given a sudden big cash injection, more men than
        women would hit the shops \u2013 with 18% compared to 15% saying they\u2019d
        go on a spending spree. </p><h2>Spending habits and payment preferences </h2><p>There
        are differences between how men and women pay for goods and services. More
        men than women have a credit or charge card, and are more likely to pay off
        their credit card balance. </p><p>Women tend to make more use of their debit
        card for everyday spending and are far more likely to have a store card, with
        one in five having one compared to just over one in ten men.\u00a0 </p><h2>Tackling
        debt head on </h2><p>The report refers to research from the debt charity StepChange,
        which says women account for 55% of those seeking advice. However, women are
        more likely to contact the charity about smaller levels of personal debt.
        StepChange records the average amount women owed in 2013 was \u00a314,412,
        compared with \u00a317,953 for men. </p><p>If you are concerned about money

        to go to get free debt advice</a>. </p><h2>Planning for retirement </h2><p>The
        average person believes they could afford to retire at 66. This is four years
        later than women would like to and three years after men would prefer to stop
        working. One in three women didn\u2019t know at what age they would be entitled
        to retire, compared with one in six men \u2013 most thought they couldn\u2019t
        retire until they were 70.\u00a0 </p><p>In fact, the State retirement age
        for women depends on when they were born, although anyone born after 6 March
        1961 won\u2019t receive a State pension until they are 67. </p><p>For more

        href=\"http://savvywoman.co.uk\">SavvyWoman</a> said: <em>\u201cWomen are
        definitely feeling the squeeze more than men. It could be because they\u2019re
        more aware of the day to day costs of running the household \u2013 and food,
        energy and childcare costs have all increased by more than inflation.</em></p><p><em>\u201cMoney
        may not be the joint task that couples think it is, especially among older
        couples. Two thirds of women married or living with their partner said that
        managing things like savings, investments and the pension was a joint task
        whereas only 27% of men did!\"</em></p><p>Sarah added: <em>\u201cWomen were
        definitely less keen to invest in shares, or to put their money into precious
        metals or other commodities. But I think we dispelled one myth when we found
        that more men than women would head to the shops for a spending spree with
        their \u00a3100,000 windfall!\u201d</em></p>","date":"2014-06-10T14:20:58+00:00"},{"id":"greatest-ever-drive-to-reach-uks-carers-launched","title":"Greatest

        to buy-to-let? Three things you need to consider","description":"If you''re
        thinking of buy-to-let, there are differences to standard mortgages.","body":"<p
        class=\"intro\"> Buy-to-let mortgages might sound like a good way to make
        money, but they can be more expensive and risky than a standard house purchase
        - plus there are other expenses to bear in mind. </p><p> And even if you''ve
        already calculated you can afford the risk, there are some things you need
        to know. </p><p>New HSBC research shows rental properties in Southampton are
        yielding 8.73% - that\u2019s the percentage of additional rent over the mortgage
        value - with Manchester, Nottingham, Blackpool and Hull the next best for
        returns. Meanwhile Brighton and Reading have the fastest growing returns as
        rental prices rise there. </p><p>They\u2019re lower in London as house prices
        have risen faster than rents. Any future increase in interest rates would
        affect yields too. </p><p> See our advice below to see whether buy-to-let
        is right for you. </p><h2>It can be difficult to get one </h2><p>You\u2019ll
        struggle to get a buy-to-let mortgage if you don\u2019t already own your own
        home, whether outright or with an outstanding mortgage. And you are likely
        to find it hard to get a buy-to-let mortgage unless you earn at least \u00a325,000
        a year. </p><p> You\u2019ll also need good credit and be able to finish the
        mortgage by the time you are 70. </p><p> For more details of who can get one
        and how read our <a title=\"Buy-to-let mortgages\" href=\"https://www.moneyadviceservice.org.uk/en/articles/buy-to-let-mortgages\">Buy-to-let
        mortgages</a> guide. </p><h2>They''re not subject to the new\u00a0mortgage
        rules </h2><p>Unlike buying a home to live in, the mortgage will be treated
        as a commercial loan, and as such it''s unregulated. That means you won''t
        necessarily go through the same affordability tests. Instead it will be based
        around your rental income - although some lenders will look at what you can
        afford based on income to check you can still make the payments when the property
        is empty. </p><p>The rental income will need to be verified by a surveyor
        and it will typically need to be 25% higher than the mortgage payment. So
        if your monthly payment is \u00a31000, the rent you charge needs to be at
        least \u00a31,250. </p><h2>Don\u2019t forget the additional costs </h2><p>It\u2019s
        not just\u00a0a solicitor you need to account for. You may have fees for letting
        agents, maintenance costs, special landlord and rent\u00a0insurances\u00a0and
        even capital gains taxes when you sell. Plus the property could be empty between
        tenants. </p><p> There are also many other costs that come with any house
        purchase. Money Advice Service research revealed that 55% found the total
        bill for buying a home more than they expected. </p><p> Read <a title=\"First-time

        for more than half of all transactions, but more and more people are finding
        ways to go ''cashless''. </p><p>How much cash do you use? If you\u2019re like
        most of the country it\u2019s less and less. The British Retail Consortium\u2019s
        Payments Survey 2013 shows that cash is only used in 53% of all transactions,

        most popular way to pay last year with 32% of all transactions. When you pay

        card lets you spend money on credit (you borrow it from the bank), and can
        be a safe, secure way to spend. But if you don\u2019t pay it back straight

        more recent way to use your debit or credit card lets you simply tap it on
        a reader, making it much quicker. You don\u2019t use a pin for this and payments
        are limited to \u00a320. Not all cards can do this and not all shops have
        the readers. Look out for the contactless symbol for compatibility. </p><h2>4.\u00a0Spend
        online instead </h2><p>Buying things online means you can\u2019t pay with
        cash. You can use cards or a registered payment service linked to your account
        such as PayPal. <br/><a title=\"E-payments - why, when and how to use them\"

        phone number </h2><p>Paym (pronounced Pay-Em) is a partnership between many
        of the banks that lets you send money to someone with just their mobile phone
        number.\u00a0 As long as you and the receiver are registered, you use your
        phone banking apps to pay someone without the need for cash or account numbers
        and sort codes. The end of finding the right change to pay your friend back
        for lunch? </p><h2>6.\u00a0Get a digital wallet </h2><p>This isn\u2019t just
        cashless shopping, it\u2019s cardless and uses a mobile phone linked to your
        bank account. They work in different ways. Your handset might have a chip
        that is swiped in the same way as contactless cards. Others let you pay through
        scanning a QR code or by \u2018checking in\u2019. It\u2019s still in its early
        days right now, but possibly one for the near future. </p><h2>7.\u00a0Go virtual
        with Bitcoin </h2><p>Bitcoin is a digital currency that isn\u2019t managed,
        regulated or protected by any country or banks, effectively cutting out the
        middle men and removing international and card fees. It\u2019s virtual as
        no money is printed, so all payments have to be with a computer or app. Similar
        to the digital wallet, some tech savvy shops will let you pay in bitcoin.
        </p><h2>8.\u00a0Preload money on a card </h2><p>A prepaid card is loaded with
        money in advance. You can only spend the money you put on it so it\u2019s
        a popular way to give kids an allowance, take money abroad or a handy way

        to Buy</a>\u00a0is aimed at first-time buyers with low deposits or current
        owners with limited equity. </p><p>It''s designed to make it easier to buy
        for people who would otherwise find themselves priced out of the market. </p><h2>Help
        to Buy explained </h2><p>Help to Buy allows people who can put down at least
        a 5% deposit on a home to buy. It does so in two main ways: </p><p><strong>Equity
        loans:</strong> the government lends you up to 20% of the purchase price of
        a new-build home costing up to \u00a3600,000 in England. A similar scheme
        is run for Scottish properties, with an upper purchase price limit of \u00a3400,000.
        No similar scheme is available for Northern Irish or Welsh properties. </p><p><strong>Mortgage
        guarantees:</strong> the government agrees to cover part of your mortgage
        if you only have a small deposit to put towards a new-build or previously-owned
        property costing up to \u00a3600,000 (except in Scotland, where the limit
        is \u00a3400,000). The government takes on the default risk if you fall behind
        with payments. This scheme is available throughout the UK. </p><h2>What you
        need to know about equity loans </h2><p>\u2022\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0You
        can borrow up to 20% of the value of your property. This is so as many people
        as possible can have access to the scheme before funds run out. </p><p>\u2022\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The
        loan must be repaid after 25 years or earlier if you sell up. </p><p>\u2022\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0You
        pay back the same proportion of loan as you borrowed. So, if you borrowed
        20% of the purchase price, you repay 20% of the sale price. </p><p>\u2022\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The
        loan is interest free for the first five years, after which interest is charged
        at a rate of 1.75%, rising annually by any increase in the Retail Price Index
        (RPI), plus 1%. RPI is a measure used to show how a number of typical household
        items rise or fall over the course of a year. </p><p>\u2022\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Your
        first mortgage must be a repayment mortgage rather than an interest-only mortgage.

        </p><p>According to this year\u2019s National Student Money Survey by Save

        to help, most are grateful they\u2019re able to support them at all. Others
        would rather accept full responsibility for their own financial situation
        than approach their parents. </p><p>The biggest surprise is that universities
        provide some level of financial support to just one in ten students, despite
        increased hardship funding being a condition of the 2012 tuition fee hike.
        </p><p>Less than one in ten students said they would turn to their university

        research shows that while shoppers might spend an average of \u00a3948 online
        each year, a good chunk of that is effectively wasted because so many clothes,
        electrical items and other goods never see the light of day. </p><p>If returning
        the items really isn''t an option, de-cluttering might be a way to make a
        bit of extra cash through sites like Amazon, eBay and Gumtree. </p><p>So,
        where to start if you''re an expert on online buying rather than selling?
        </p><h2>Be aware of the risks </h2><p>Selling online should be straightforward,
        but there are some potential problems to be aware of. In the vast majority
        of cases you won''t know who you''re selling to, all you''ll have is a name
        and address to post your package to. If something goes wrong, such as the
        buyer claiming they never received the item or it wasn''t what they expected,
        you can have difficulties in getting paid or getting the\u00a0item back. </p><p>You
        need to make sure you have a good understanding of the levels of protection
        afforded by selling sites. For instance, PayPal may be convenient, but it
        won''t cover you if you hand over an item to the buyer on the doorstep,\u00a0which
        they subsequently deny having received and fail to pay for.\u00a0 </p><p>It''s
        also important to know the timescales for dispute processes - if there is
        a problem you may need to be quick off the mark.\u00a0 </p><h2>Track your
        packages </h2><p>One way to help avoid issues is to send your packages by
        recorded delivery, so you can track their whereabouts. This is especially
        important if you''re selling higher value items. </p><p>If you are selling
        goods on eBay for more than \u00a3150 you should pay for the items to be tracked
        by the delivery service, and get it signed for. Without this proof of delivery
        you won''t get any help if the payment is fraudulent. </p><p>It''s worth keeping
        a record of any transaction, including the method of delivery. </p><p>Online
        security is another issue, with eBay among the sites which recently asked

        \u2013 establish what the going rate is for a specific item. If you have a
        DVD box set you want to sell, check what the competition is offering it for,
        as well as checking the price of a new set. Note that you will have to pay
        a small amount to use auction sites, which can be as little as 75p per item
        (VAT exclusive), plus post and packaging costs, so build these costs in when
        arriving at a sale price. </p><p><strong>\u2022\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Description</strong>
        \u2013 it\u2019s essential to give a true definition of the goods you\u2019re
        selling.\u00a0 </p><p><strong>\u2022\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Reputation</strong>
        \u2013 you can build up a highly valuable reputation on auction sites in the
        form of positive feedback from buyers, whereas those that attract negative
        responses are likely to put off potential customers, who will simply go elsewhere.
        </p><h2>Online selling and tax </h2><p>You can sell personal items without
        having to declare them up to a limit of \u00a36,000 - above that, it''s best

        reasons you could be paying too much for your car insurance","description":"You
        needn''t expect your car insurance to rise every year - use our advice to
        keep costs down","body":"<p class=\"intro\">The cost of car insurance may
        have risen steadily over the last few years, but there''s a chance you could
        be ignoring simple steps to lower your premiums. </p><p>There are a few reasons
        why your car insurance may be more costly than it needs to be. </p><p>Here
        are some of them, and what you can do to bring costs down.\u00a0 </p><h2>Your
        car is seen as risky business </h2><p>When assessing the theft risk, motor
        insurers will take into account factors that may reduce the risk, such as
        if your car is garaged overnight and if you have an approved vehicle immobiliser
        fitted. Factors that reduce the risk of theft can be reflected in the premium.
        </p><p>Driving a fast car is an easy way of paying more for your insurance
        premium\u00a0 - selecting a more average model in a lower insurance category
        will help keep the costs down . </p><p>Speeding is another way of driving
        up your premium \u2013 insurers usually charge more if you have points on
        your licence. </p><h2>You''re paying the bill each month </h2><p>Paying monthly
        can cost more as companies will sometimes charge you extra for the privilege,
        compared to paying the annual premium in one lump sum. </p><p>Keep an eye
        out for extras like breakdown cover too \u2013 for example, some bank accounts
        offer this so you may already be covered. </p><p>It might also be cheaper
        to buy this separately. </p><h2>Forgotten your no-claims bonus? </h2><p>If
        you don\u2019t tell your new insurer about your no-claims bonus, then your
        premium could be higher as a result. </p><p>It is worth considering paying
        an extra premium to protect your no-claims bonus, if you qualify for five
        years or more of no-claims bonus. </p><p>See\u00a0<a title=\"Car insurance

        insurance - choose the right level of cover.</a>\u00a0 </p><h2>You\u2019ve
        failed to shop around </h2><p>According to MoneySuperMarket.com, UK drivers
        are wasting \u00a31.9 billion annually by remaining with their existing car
        insurer and failing to shop around for a better deal. </p><p>The comparison
        site found 8.6 million drivers across the country automatically renew their
        car insurance policy with the same provider every year. </p><p>The more time
        and research you put in to obtaining quotes, the more likely you are to get
        a better deal. </p><p>This is especially important if you are over 70 or under
        25, and at the first year renewal when premiums can go up significantly. </p><p>If
        you have the time, get quotes from at least two comparison sites and use insurers
        and brokers that don\u2019t feature on comparison sites. Remember, cheapest
        is not necessarily best. </p><p>Get the right cover or your policy will not
        pay out when you need it. </p><p>See our advice on <a title=\"Car insurance

        online, especially when clothes shopping. But hoarding unused purchases at
