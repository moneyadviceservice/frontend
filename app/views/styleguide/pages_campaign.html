      <p>
        Interest rates are likely to rise, maybe later this year or perhaps in 2015. The rises may be small and gradual, and they’ll affect everyone with a mortgage. But new research from the Money Advice Service shows three out of four homeowners haven’t considered how a rise would affect their repayments.
      </p>
      <p>
        More than half of homeowners would find it hard to cover an increase of £150 a month, while three out of four would struggle to pay an extra £200 a month.
      </p>
