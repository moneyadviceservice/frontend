        money management","description":"","content":"<p><strong>Wednesday 16 November
        2016</strong></p>\n\n<p>New research from the Money Advice Service reveals
        that people across the UK could be better off by around £108 billion over
        the next 30 years if they were a better able to manage their money.</p>\n\n<p>Research
        shows that people’s confidence and skills in dealing with money issues, known
        as “Financial Capability” remains stubbornly low. This means they could be
        missing out on the financial benefits that relatively small changes in their
        money management can bring. These benefits include increased investments of
        almost £50 billion, increased savings of nearly £20 billion and increased
        pensions of around £10 billion. People would have more spending power so consumption
        would be expected to increase by almost £30 billion. Importantly, those currently
        least able to manage their money would stand to benefit by £45 billion over
        30 years.</p>\n\n<p>The research, The Economic Impact of Improved Financial
        Capability, marks the first time that the UK wide impact of improved budgeting,
        credit and savings decisions has been assessed. At a time when the UK’s financial
        capability is stubbornly low, these figures show that improving money skills
        could have a range of benefits for consumers over the long term.</p>\n\n<p>People
        with higher financial capability would be able to shop around to make money
        go further, understand compound interest, save regularly, and reduce impulse
        spending. As their capability increases, people would put more money into
        savings accounts and investments, with wealth increases estimated at around
        £80 billion over 30 years. People would also get better value for money as
        they start to shop around for the best deals on financial products, seeking
        lower interest rates on credit cards, loans and lower charges for investment
        products.</p>\n\n<p>The incidence of over-indebtedness would fall by up to
        thirteen percent as a result of people better adapting their spending to their
        income, and becoming less dependent on high cost credit products. Reduced
        over-indebtedness brings other benefits, including improved health and wellbeing.</p>\n\n<p>Finally,
        the finance industry would see increased demand for saving and investment
        products as well as more people seeking the best financial advice to help
        with their decisions.</p>\n\n<p>Commenting on the findings, David Haigh, Director
        of Financial Capability for the Money Advice Service said: “The staggering
        numbers show clearly for the first time that small improvements to people’s
        money skills could have a huge impact at both an individual and national level,
        with a<br />\npositive effect on people’s wealth, and increased competition
        and innovation across the finance industry. As we embark on the first ever
        Financial Capability Week, this report provides an important reminder of why
        policy makers, the financial services industry, and other organisations must
        work together to find new ways to help people make the most of their money
        and make a real difference to their lives and tackle the low levels of financial
        capability across the UK.”</p>\n\n<p><strong>ENDS</strong></p>\n\n<p><strong>For

        TO EDITORS</strong></p>\n\n<p><strong>About the</strong> <strong>Economic
        Impact of Financial Capability</strong> <strong>Report</strong></p>\n\n<p>The
        report is from Europe Economics, an independent economics consultancy. It
        uses data from the 2015 Financial Capability Survey (FCS) to simulate the
        financial lives of over 3000 real individuals over their remaining lives if
        their financial capability was improved. The model captures expected behaviours
        by modelling assumptions and conditions to describe the role of financial
        capability in peoples’ budgeting, credit and saving decisions. The modelling
        approach is fully described at Chapter 4 of the report. The policies needed
        to increase people’s financial capability was outside the scope of the research.
        The full report can be found <a href=\"https://masassets.blob.core.windows.net/cms/files/000/000/569/original/EE_Study_on_Economic_Impact_of_Improved_Capability_4-Nov-2016_-_Final.docx\">here</a>.</p>\n\n<p><strong>What
        is financial capability?</strong></p>\n\n<p>Financial capability is a person’s
        ability to manage money well, both day to day and through significant life
        events, and to handle periods of financial difficulty. It is driven by personal
        skills, knowledge, attitudes and motivations, and made possible by an inclusive
        financial system and supportive social environment. Financial capability helps
        people achieve the best possible financial wellbeing.</p>\n\n<p><strong>About
        the Money Advice Service</strong></p>\n\n<p>The Money Advice Service is an
        independent organisation. It gives free, unbiased money guidance online at
        <a href=\"http://moneyadviceservice.org.uk\">moneyadviceservice.org.uk</a>
        or via free phone on <a href=\"tel:0800%20138%207777\">0800 138 7777</a>.
        Debt advice is also provided through a variety of partners across the UK.
        The Service was set up by Government and is paid for by a statutory levy on
        the financial services industry, raised through the Financial Conduct Authority.
        Its statutory objectives are to enhance the understanding and knowledge of
        members of the public about financial matters (including the UK financial
        system); and to enhance the ability of members of the public to manage their
        own financial affairs.</p>\n","published_at":"2016-11-16T00:01:00.000Z","objectID":"/en/corporate/press-release-uk-could-gain-108-from-improved-money-management","_highlightResult":{"title":{"value":"Press

        people than ever getting help with money matters from the Money Advice Service</strong></p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>Over
        8.4 million unique contacts to Money Advice Service website between April
        and September – 88% would recommend the service to others</li>\n  <li>More
        people seeking help with their debts, over 95,000 sessions take place this
        quarter - an increase of 90% on Q2 2014/15</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>The Money Advice
        Service continued to evolve its approach this quarter, placing greater emphasis
        on working with partners to help more consumers than ever get the financial
        support they need to make informed decisions about their money.</p>\n\n<p>Figures
        for Quarter 2 (July – September 2015) show that the Money Advice Service achieved
        over 5.9 million customer visits to the website, phone and face to face services,
        a total of over 11.4 million for the first half of the year. In the same period,
        3.4 million actions were taken to improve budgeting and 481,530 actions were
        taken to save regularly.</p>\n\n<p>The homes and mortgages tools remained
        the most popular with over 420,900 completions in total including; over 197,000
        completions of the Stamp duty calculator, over 142,000 completions for the
        Mortgage Affordability Calculator and nearly 82,000 for the Mortgage calculator.</p>\n\n<p>More
        people than ever sought help with their financial difficulties this quarter,
        continuing the upward trend. We worked closely with partners <em>across the
        country; whose hard work and dedication resulted in over 95,000 people receiving
        debt advice across England, Wales, and Scotland. Nine out of 10 people*</em>
        who received debt advice went on to take an action to improve their finances.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Focusing
        on Financial Education</strong><br />\nWe launched two financial education
        projects this quarter, designed to identify what really works in improving
        financial capability. These will enable the Service to innovate to reach more
        people with messages about good financial behaviours while investing in the
        wider sector to increase the capacity of partners and the charitable sector
        to deliver projects which will help to make a real difference to people’s
        lives.</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li><strong>​</strong><strong>Collaboration with the
        Education Endowment Foundation (EEF)</strong> –We co-funded a project to evaluate
        the effectiveness of school-based financial education programmes. The aim
        is to increase the financial capability of school pupils and raise their educational
        attainment.</li>\n  <li><strong>Collaboration with Big Lottery Wales</strong>
        - We commenced work with the Big Lottery Fund in Wales on a new pilot project
        called Talk, Learn, Do: Parents, Kids and Money. This scheme aims to improve
        parent’s confidence to teach their children money management skills. The three
        year project, which will be delivered across almost half of all local authorities
        in Wales, aims to motivate parents and equip them with the confidence and
        ability to develop the next generation of money savvy adults.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p><strong>Debt
        funding for Northern Ireland</strong><br />\nWe continued to work with partners
        to ensure that consumers in Northern Ireland have access to high quality,
        free debt advice across all 11 council areas. This will enable them to get
        their debts under control and improve their quality of life. Applications
        for a three-year debt advice funding programme in Northern Ireland opened
        in September with up to £1 million_*_available to potential partners in the
        first year.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Encouraging people to plan for the future</strong><br
        />\nThe Service and the Association of British Insurers (ABI) launched a joint
        piece of consumer research identifying the barriers and triggers to getting
        protection, whether that takes the form of a savings buffer or a protection
        product. The findings were used to raise awareness of the need to either save
        or consider relevant protection insurances.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Commenting on
        these results, Caroline Rookes, CEO of the Money Advice Service said:</strong>
        “I am pleased to see that the website continues to extend its reach, with
        more consumers getting access to the information they need to make good decisions
        about their money. I’m also delighted that more people than ever are seeking
        debt advice.</p>\n\n<p>“We are continuing to look for new ways to fill gaps
        in information for consumers and to co-ordinate with partners to reach people
        more effectively. Our work with the Education Endowment Fund, Big Lottery
        Wales, Association of British Insurers and our debt partners are a great example
        of this. We’ll continue to take this approach–aiming to create a real cultural
        change in the way people think about money.”</p>\n\n<p><strong>ENDS</strong></p>\n\n<p><strong>For

        regulated advice as part of the guidance journey. Millions of people access
        these guidance services each year, through the web, phone and printed materials

        is an important step in ensuring that advice is widely available to all that
        would benefit from it.</p>\n\n<p>Lighthouse’s contract will run until March
        2018. They will offer every permanent member of MAS staff the chance to have
        a complimentary financial review. The group will also run day surgeries for
        1-2-1 meetings, seminars on key financial topics and offer discounted rates

        advice has an important role to play in ensuring that people make the right
        choices about their money – not only for our staff but for the wider public.
        A vital step in the guidance journey is signposting consumers towards regulated
        financial advice at the appropriate time.”</p>\n\n<p><strong>Malcolm Streatfield,
        Chief Executive Officer of Lighthouse commented:</strong> “We are very pleased

        14 November 2016</strong></p>\n\n<p>Less than half of young people aged seven
        to 17 are receiving financial education at school.</p>\n\n<p>New findings
        by the Money Advice Service, released today at the launch of Financial Capability
        Week 2016, shows that just 4 in 10 young people in the UK say they’ve received
        financial education, which is designed to teach children how to handle their
        finances confidently and is currently part of the curriculum across the UK.</p>\n\n<p>This,
        despite the fact that an overwhelming 90% who’d received financial education
        lessons said they found them useful. In addition, the survey findings showed
        that only 7% of children surveyed said they’d taken the time to speak to their
        teacher about money.</p>\n\n<p>There is an issue outside of the classroom
        too, with only 61% of parents admitting that they feel confident talking to
        their children about money and with only one-third involving their children
        in discussions about their household finances.</p>\n\n<p>When young people
        don’t receive financial education, it can mean that they’re poorly prepared
        to manage their own money as they approach adulthood. Today’s research clearly
        demonstrates this – among 16 – 17 year olds, 32% said they didn’t have experience
        of putting money into a bank account, 39% said they didn’t have a current
        account at all and a shocking 59% couldn’t read a pay slip.</p>\n\n<p>The
        first ever Financial Capability Week, beginning today (14 Nov), is designed
        to raise awareness of the importance of financial capability – that is, people’s
        ability to manage their money well, both day-to-day and through significant
        life events, such as losing their job, having a child or suffering a bereavement.</p>\n\n<p>Suella
        Fernandes MP, Chair of the All Party Parliamentary Group on Financial Education,
        said: “These research findings clearly show that there is plenty more to do
        to improve the delivery of financial education, which remains inconsistent
        and varying in effectiveness. It’s essential that we provide appropriate training
        and resources for teachers to enable them to deliver these crucial lessons.</p>\n\n<p>“A
        collaborative approach is absolutely vital in tackling this issue – we must
        encourage educators, policy makers and other organisations to work together
        to deliver effective financial education to our children. The All Party Parliamentary
        Group on Financial Education for Young People has recommended the Department
        for Education embed financial education within the new Initial Teacher Training
        framework. In order to ensure high quality provision schools should appoint
        a financial education ‘champion’, ideally a member of the Senior Leadership
        Team, to coordinate and promote learning and training in this area.”</p>\n\n<p>David
        Haigh, Director of Financial Capability at the Money Advice Service, said
        “The fact that only 40% of pupils reported receiving financial education show
        that gaps exist in the provision of financial education. Given that so few
        children actually speak to their teachers about money matters, there’s a clear
        role for parents to fulfil in helping prepare their children to manage their
        money in adult life. However, we know that only one-third of parents talk
        to their children about household finances.</p>\n\n<p>“In addition, parents’
        money management may not set the best example. Half (50%) do not save regularly,
        44% say they don’t feel confident managing their money and 68% say they find
        keeping up with their credit commitments and bills a burden.</p>\n\n<p>“In
        order to find a lasting solution to the problem of the UK’s stubbornly low
        levels financial capability, we need to help parents be better role models,
        build their confidence in speaking to their children about these matters and
        support schools to deliver effective financial education.”</p>\n\n<p>Elona
        Gega, a student from London who received financial education through a scheme
        provided by financial education charity MyBnk, benefitted from receiving financial
        education. She said: “Money is real to me now! Learning how to manage it and
        avoid bad debt has improved my confidence, cut my spending and opened up new
        opportunities. I have just started living independently and want to go to
        university, it’s really important I know how to take care of my finances.
        Today, I feel like I’m in control of my money rather than it being in control
        of me.”</p>\n\n<p>Russell Winnard. Head of Educator Facing Programme and Services
        at Young Enterprise, said: “Collaboration between organisations is absolutely
        vital to ensure that young people receive high quality financial education.
        By sharing information on effective approaches, the way in which financial
        education is delivered can change for the better. The Financial Education
        Quality Mark is an accreditation awarded to teaching resources that are accurate,
        engaging and of the highest standard, to allow educators to identify the best
        financial education materials.</p>\n\n<p>“Today, we launch a revised version
        of the Quality Mark – the new version will support providers in evaluating
        how effective their resources are and share their findings with others. Doing
        so provides the opportunity to create the most effective, consistent financial
        education resources, thereby improving the standard of financial education
        for children across the UK.”</p>\n\n<p><strong>-ENDS-</strong></p>\n\n<p><strong>NOTES

        in 2011 after a career leading major transformational change as a consultant.</p>\n\n<p>Announcing
        Charles’s appointment, <strong>Andy Briscoe, Chair of the Money Advice Service

        has a wealth of experience in a number of key areas. He is passionate about
        tackling financial capability, understands the challenges surrounding crisis

        complex transition projects. He is also very experienced in managing complex
        stakeholder relationships and is well-known and respected within Government
        and the sectors we engage with.”</p>\n\n<p><strong>Charles Counsell said:</strong></p>\n\n<p>“Making
        sure people have easy access to the guidance they need to steer through critical
        financial issues is very important to the UK, and I am both honoured and excited
        to have the chance to build on the Money Advice Service’s work so far. My
        experience of guiding organisations though periods of profound change will
        I’m sure be invaluable as we move towards establishing the new single financial
        guidance body.”</p>\n\n<p>Charles will join the Money Advice Service on 5
        June 2017. He will formally join the Board at its meeting in June. Caroline
